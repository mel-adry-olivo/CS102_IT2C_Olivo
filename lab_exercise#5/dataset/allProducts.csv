"4","STAEDTLER 121-2 BK5D Noris School Graphite Pencils - HB Degree (Pack of 5), Black","Good value pencils for when you want a harder lead.","limner","This mixed pack of the reliable  Staedtler Noris pencils are good value. You get a 2B,B,HB,H and 2H in a blister pack. I use these pencils for tracing and transferring designs where you need a solid, hard lead. I feel Staedtler's grades are harder than other brands so look elsewhere for my soft sketching pencils, saving these for where I need a clean line. They sharpen and erase well, don't break easily and keep their point well. These are a good set for technical drawing and the occasions when you need a harder lead.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Ces crayons ne sont pas les moins chers que l'on puisse trouver, mais le prix est plus que largement compensé par leur qualité. Ces crayons sont solides, tant la partie bois que la parie graphite. Si ils tombent, la mine intérieure ne casse pas comme c'est le cas sur les crayons bas de gamme. Lors de la taille, le bois est proprement coupé par la lame du taille crayon, au lieu d'être déchiqueté comme c'est le cas aussi avec les produits bas de gamme. Le graphite utilisé est de qualité, permettant un taillage pointu ou plus rond. La qualité d'écriture est bien là: ça ne bave pas, on réalise des tracés précis.Idéal aussi bien pour les adultes que pour les enfants, qui ont tendance à les faire tomber fréquemment et à les tailler souvent !","Reviewed in France on 12 February 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Meine bisherigen Bleistifte hatten die ""nette"" Angewohnheit, dass wenn sie einmal zu Boden gefallen waren, die Mine innerhalb des Bleistiftes mehrfach gebrochen war. Also war der Stift immer nur wenige Millimeter anspitzbar, bis dann die Mine wieder eine Bruchstelle frei gab. Nicht diese Stifte! Auch nach x-maligen Herunterfallen (in der Werkstatt leider ein normales Geschehen) brach die Mine noch bei keinem der Stifte! Die Dinger scheinen unzerstörbar! Abgesehen davon liegen sie gut in der Hand, und durch die auffällige Farbgebung finde ich sie auch im Werkstattchaos relativ einfach. Aber auch beim normalen Schreibgebrauch sind diese Stifte wirklich toll. Der Abrieb der Mine ist relativ gering, so dass man nicht alle paar Sätze lang wieder nachspitzen muss. Nur eine Kleinigkeit, aber auch erwähnenswert: die Stifte kamen wunderbar gespitzt an. Also: klasse Bleistifte!","Reviewed in Germany on 25 March 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"219","BIC Evolution Graphite Pencils - Box of 12 - HB Lead with Colourful Striped Design - Wood-Free and Splinter-Proof, Yellow,Green,Pink,Red,Black","Serh gute Bleistifte","P. und G. Arentzen","Schon die alten Ägypter nutzten Blei, um wichtige und weniger wichtige Informationen festzuhalten. Und das vor über 5.000 Jahren.Bis zum heutigen Bleistift war es freilich ein weiter Weg und ich fürchte, dass keine weltbewegenden Dokumente mit ihnen unterzeichnet, wohl aber womöglich konzipiert wurden.Heute sind Bleistifte in den meisten Haushalten zu finden und ganz sicher findet man sie im Mäppchen von Schülern aller Altersstufen.Die hier vorliegenden Evolution-Bleistifte von BIC kommen gänzlich ohne Holz aus. Sie sind sechseckig,  bestehen aus Kunstharz, sind komplett durchgefärbt und kommen in der Stärke HB daher.In einer Blister-Verpackung ruhen vier Stück; braucht man sie nicht alle, muss man sich also einen guten Aufbewahrungsort ausdenken.Dank ihrer Form liegen sie gut in der Hand. Auch Kinder – Testobjekt war hier meine siebenjährige Enkelin – konnte gut damit malen und schreiben.Anfangs hatte ich aufgrund von Material und Form ein wenig Angst, die Stifte könnten sich nicht gut spitzen lassen.  Aber diese Angst war unbegründet - in einem normalen Spitzer lassen sich die Spitzer mühelos spitzen.Hat man die Kinder , dann weiß man eines - sie lassen die Stifte fallen, und schon brechen die Minen. Dies ist hier anders, wie ein Bruchtest ergab. Auch mehrfaches Hinunterwerfen ließ die Minen nicht splittern.Fazit: Farbenfroh, gut zu handhaben und stabil – besser geht es nicht! Diese Bleistifte gehören in jedes Mäppchen, machen aber aufgrund ihrer Optik auch in Büros einen guten Eindruck.","Reviewed in Germany on 4 March 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"229","BIC Evolution Graphite Pencils - Box of 12 - HB Lead with Colourful Striped Design - Wood-Free and Splinter-Proof, Yellow,Green,Pink,Red,Black","Optisch sehr ansprechende Bleistifte","Beatriz A.","Optisch gefallen mir die Bleistifte sehr gut. Mit den frischen Farben und den weißen Streifen sind sie ein echter Hingucker. Die Stifte liegen gut in der Hand und lassen sich für holzfreie Bleistifte vergleichsweise gut anspitzen. Sehr praktisch finde ich die bruchfeste Mine. Durch sie ist es nicht dramatisch, wenn die Stifte mal hinfallen. Gerade bei Schulkindern ist dies Gold wert. Das Schreibverhalten lässt jedoch zu Wünschen übrig. So muss im Vergleich mit Bleistiften anderer Hersteller fest aufgedrückt werden, um „Farbe“ auf das Papier zu bekommen. Besonders auf glatterem Papier wie bei Schulbüchern fällt dies auf. Zum Aufzeichnen von Umrissen mit Hilfe von Schablonen auf Tonpapier, gefallen mir die Stifte dagegen gut. Auch wegradieren ist kein Problem.","Reviewed in Germany on 17 January 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

Die Mine soll nicht mehr brechen und splittern, das wird sich im Laufe der Zeit noch zeigen.

Ich arbeite an technischen Zeichnungen und zeichne/skizziere privat sehr gerne damit. Durch die sogenannten ""Fall-Druckbleistift - Minen"" benötigt man keinen Spitzer, man arbeitet immer mit derselben Linienstärke. Zudem befindet sich am Ende unter dem Druckknopf ein kleiner Radiergummi. Dieser ist mir erst nach längerem Gebrauch aufgefallen und wirklich praktisch.Wer auf Qualität setzen möchte ist hier genau am richtigen Produkt! Lediglich die 3,5mm Minen brechen sehr schnell, wenn man diese zu weit herausfährt oder zu feste aufdrückt. Da diese sehr dünn sind und man da sich etwas an sanfteres Zeichnen gewöhnen muss einen Stern Abzug, nichtsdestotrotz ein sehr empfehlenswertes Produkt.","Reviewed in Germany on 4 October 2015","2.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The 0.7 and 0.5 work fine. The 0.35 was problematic. The lead (graphite) inside constantly broke when pressing the top to reveal more of the 0.35 lead, and it intermittently slipped back into the barrel of the pencil when you finally get the lead to emerge and put it to paper. I Had to remove bits of the broken lead (and the other two leads inside the pencil), make sure no small lengths left inside, then very carefully insert a single 0.35 lead and started again. This problem seems to be solved - so far - now that there is only one 0.35 lead in the pencil. This is a mechanical issue, not the leads in the pencils. These are excellent and produce smooth and consistent marks on the paper used. In conclusion: Initial disappointment from usual excellent Faber-Castell products but will monitor and report back.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I had already owned a Faber Castell 0.35 mechanical pencil but it broke from a jam due to the fine lead, I assumed it was a fluke. I really should have learnt from my first experience but I had the exact same issue with the 0.35 from this pack, it took 3 months for it to stop working after consistent feeding issues either not coming out to the whole lead sliding out of the pencil, something I would expect from a off brand mechanical pencil.As for 0.75 and 0.50. They are are fine but honestly don't bring anything any to the table that any other cheaper mechanical pencil or in fact a well sharpened standard graphite pencil would offer. Lead is nice I guess, if a little frail but you can just buy the lead separately and put it into another, better pencil. They also look nice with good grip and handling but other brands offer that luxury for cheaper.Looking at other reviews this is a common problem for anyone who actually attempts to use this pencil. I would not recommend this set.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 February 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Ces crayons ne sont pas les moins chers que l'on puisse trouver, mais le prix est plus que largement compensé par leur qualité. Ces crayons sont solides, tant la partie bois que la parie graphite. Si ils tombent, la mine intérieure ne casse pas comme c'est le cas sur les crayons bas de gamme. Lors de la taille, le bois est proprement coupé par la lame du taille crayon, au lieu d'être déchiqueté comme c'est le cas aussi avec les produits bas de gamme. Le graphite utilisé est de qualité, permettant un taillage pointu ou plus rond.

"355","STAEDTLER 100B G6 Mars Lumograph Pencils, Black, Pack of 6","Iconic pencil","René68","These are excellent premium quality pencils by Staedtler for sketching. There are 12 x 8mm pencils in total ranging from 2H to 8B. The degrees of softness are: 2H, H, F, HB, B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B, 8B. They are presented in a nice metal tin which provides good protection and easy access. The highly distinctive blue, silver and black top livery is iconic and it hasn't changed in years.I have used these pencils before and they have never let me down. This set is excellent for building up tone in portrait or landscape sketches for example. They sharpen well without splintering, and are comfortable to hold and use. The graphite is super smooth on paper and does not scratch at all like cheaper pencils. The graphite also erases easily so you can perfect your work. There is something very nice and satisfying about a good quality pencil like this one. This is a great set for any artist or student alike.

"357","STAEDTLER 100B G6 Mars Lumograph Pencils, Black, Pack of 6","Beautiful quality pencils.","Farrah","Beautiful and quality pencils. These pencils are pretty much the benchmark for their quality of material and standard tonal values I.e. the blackness/hardness. The casing material is of great wood quality.Mars Lumograph 100 series pencils have a little metallic lustre when drawn on paper. So, if you don't want any metallic shining on your drawings then you can buy Lumograph Matt Black series pencils instead. Both kinds have their particular usefulness and none of it inferior to the other. I love these pencils for technical drawing purposes.I recieved the box in time and in a packaging of amazon polybag. The tin box has a little dent on it but that's okay. One of the pencils (F grade) seems to have manufacturing defect. It seems it was broken and then was glued and painted over it. So that can possibly be a disappointment once I use the pencil enough to reach the point of the wood cleavage and if then it happens to be unusable. However, there is no match to staedtler for quality art supplies for professionals.An advice to beginner artists: it is always advisable to start your art journey from average quality and cheaper pencils as long as their tonal grades are consistent. I highly feel that expensive pencils are meant for professional artists if money is a constraint. Once you graduate into a better and experienced artist, go ahead and buy these beautiful standard pencils.","Reviewed in India on 21 October 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"359","STAEDTLER 100B G6 Mars Lumograph Pencils, Black, Pack of 6","Staedtler Mars Lumograph Black: finalmente ombre nere e opache !","Dheeraj Kumar","Ho acquistato queste matite Mars Lumograph Black perché ero rimasto molto contento della grafite 8B della stessa marca, contenuta nell'ottimo set da 12 Mars Lumograph ""normali"", anch'esso in vendita su Amazon.In effetti, questa grafite Mars Lumograph 8B è particolarissima. Molto nera e quasi ""grassa"", è poco cancellabile come se fosse una matita colorata ed in breve è diventata la mia preferita (allego la palette dell'intero set, a lato di un piccolo bozzetto che feci tempo fa per esemplificare l'uso delle varie gradazioni di grafite).È allora che sono venuto a conoscenza di questo nuovo tipo di matite della Staedtler, sempre Mars Lumograph ma di tipo ""Black"", anch'esse in grafite ma di colore molto più nero del normale per la presenza di una più alta percentuale di carbone; vedendole in vendita qui su Amazon, le ho acquistate per curiosità.Fatta esclusione per la 8B del set Mars Lumograph ""normale"" che è del tutto simile con la 8B di tipo ""Black"", le altre gradazioni non sono da confondere però, in quanto a resa grafica, né con quelle in normale grafite né con le matite a carboncino.Delle prime non hanno quei fastidiosi riflessi lucidi avendo una finitura opaca, e delle seconde non possiedono la friabilità propria del carbone.Sono pastose e poco cancellabili come se fossero delle matite colorate nere, ma a differenza di queste sono sfumabili anche con le dita, hanno una mina resistentissima e molto affilabile, e soprattutto sono di quattro gradazioni diverse: la confezione comprende due matite di gradazione 2B, due 4B, una 6B e una 8B.Io le uso spesso e con piacere perché queste matite Black consentono agli amanti di questo tipo di tecnica, semplicemente ripassando un sottile strato sulle zone fatte con la grafite normale dove si vuole che sia reso un nero più profondo, di attenuare anche l'effetto lucido tipico della grafite.Queste Mars Lumograph Black sono un complemento anche per chi ama disegnare con il carboncino: le rifiniture, i particolari e le ombre più scure possono essere aggiunte con profitto dopo la stesura del fissatore ottenendo risultati molto convincenti.Allego tra le immagini il confronto tra la matita Lumograph in normale grafite di gradazione 8B e la sua ""gemella"" 8B Lumograph Black: entrambe hanno la mina di diametro maggiore delle altre gradazioni: ben 4,5 mm., mentre per le Black 6B, 4B e 2B il diametro è di 3,6.Le Mars Lumograph Black sono contenute in una pratica scatola metallica con una funzionale cerniera apribile (molto comoda per coloro che disegnano sovente anche all'aperto o in altre svariate condizioni ambientali), ed inoltre, al di là dell'abituale eleganza, riportano intelligentemente su ognuna delle sei facce la gradazione (caratteristica comodissima per un disegnatore).Consiglio a tutti gli appassionati di disegno, professionisti e non, l'acquisto delle Lumograph black, perché la resa è in definitiva qualcosa di diverso: diverso dalle grafiti, diverso dai carboncini, diverso dalle matite colorate. Si ha un ibrido di cui davvero si sentiva la mancanza a livello grafico.P.S.:Ora che sto scrivendo noto che ne hanno prodotto un kit in cui le matite Lumograph Black sono tutte di gradazioni diverse, avendo aggiunto la HB e la 7B: le acquisterò non appena ""nanizzate"" queste.Spero di esservi stato utile.","Reviewed in Italy on 27 June 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Having them split into two lines gives so much more options. They are nice & dark, as dark as Cretacolor Neros & darker than Faber Castell Matte but not as smooth as either, you can feel just a bit of grab on the paper. You can erase but minimally & smudging/blending with stumps or tortillons is also minimal but that helps make sketchbook drawings stay less messy.

Bien por vaguería o porque soy demasiado principiante para darme cuenta, voy buscando un tipo de lápiz que me permita negros intensos, pero que luego no tenga que andar con fijadores para que no se me vaya o se traspase a la hoja de al lado. Los Conté igual se acercaban un poco pero siguen manchando allá por donde pasan.Estos cayeron en mis manos después de ver varios análisis. Al principio me resultaba algo extraña la sensación, ya que no son suaves como un grafito, son como una cera dura, pero los resultados me gustaron mucho. Alcanzan negros mucho más intensos que un grafito (aunque el Steadtler normal 8B no está nada mal) y no tienes ese brillo del grafito que puede ser molesto. A medida que los usas y te acostumbras vas obteniendo mejores resultados y te van gustando más. Se quedan bastante bien en el papel, no difuminan mal, no manchan ni necesitan de fijador.

I was pleasantly surprised with the durability of the pencils, they have a sort of flex to them which is to reduce the lead breaking when the kids inevitably drop them.

The box has a fair bit of damage and wear, as does the plastic holding the pencils. Sadly the pencils were also not entirely in the correct sorting arrangement - this could have been impacted by delivery but wildly disappointing to get something that was slightly worn and not ‘new looking’ that I had to sort into colour…Met the purpose but not my expectations.","Reviewed in France on 3 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Beim Anspitzen hat man das Gefühl, als würden sich die Stifte biegen, liegt vermutlich daran, dass die Stifte aus splitterfreiem Material hergestellt werden. Für mich kein guter Kauf.Da bleib ich lieber bei Faber Castell Classic Colour Buntstiften, die lassen sich für mein Empfinden mit wesentlich weniger Mühe vermalen und es gibt ein Set mit 60 Farben. Auch die BIC Intensity Premium Buntstifte sind viel besser zu vermalen und haben dabei eine sehr satte Farbabgabe. Leider habe ich hier aber nur ein Set mit 24 Farben gefunden, was mir persönlich zu wenig verschiedene Farben sind.","Reviewed in Italy on 15 January 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"508","Mechanical pencil Pentel PG1013-E GraphGear1000, line width 0.3 mm, rubber (Z2-1N), 1 piece","By far my favorite mechanical pencil","Jossan","I like this pencil so much, I purchased all 5 sizes this time: 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9.  My favorite lead is 2B.  It's softer and much darker than the standard HB. H=Hard. The lead range is 4H, 3H...to HB, B...3B, 4B.  When I'm checking construction sites, I use 0.9 to write erasable info on wood, walls, and other materials, wet or dry, regardless of temperatures. Not so with Sharpies and wax pencils. In the office, I use 0.5 and 0.7 for paperwork, blueprints, etc. The British all-time favorite is 0.4. I use the 0.3 for adding tiny details to building drawings and it matches my love for 0.38 gel-ink (ultra-fine) pens.GraphGear 1000s are great mechanical pencils. The only ones with fully retractable pencil points. I use Pentel Clicking erasers instead of the endcaps. It seems like too much work to stop writing, pull-off the endcap, erase, then put it back on. In half that time, I've grabbed an eraser and done.  I had the same problem with the 0.7 pencil breaking like a couple of other Amazon reviewers. That blue ring in the middle of the pencil is plastic, which I didn't know until I found my pencil broken. Easy fix though. I put the two pieces back together and taped it super tight with black electrical tape - the good stuff (3M Temflex). Temflex is very durable, stretches a little, resistant to both water and extreme temperatures. 4 weeks later, my pencil still works like new and looks good. I kind of like the black tape. It's one more way of knowing which pencils are mine. Electrical tape comes in many colors. I plan to tape my other pencils too. So far, my new replacement 0.7 is not needed.NOTE: The price of lead refills varies a lot across Amazon. Also, Pentel has two sources. Ain Pentel is from Japan. I'm guessing the other is from China. ROtring, Staedtler, and Mars are brands well-known by engineers, architects, and draftsmen.  Faber-Castell is well-known in the art world. Presently, I trying Mr. Pen because I really like their gel highlighters and lower prices. So far, no complaints. But I have both Ain Pentel and Pentel waiting in the wings. Also, I don't care about the little bar code sticker on all my pencils because my hands never touch it except during lead refilling. Buy the GraphGear 1000. It's pricey but worth it if you write with pencil a lot.","Reviewed in Sweden on 9 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"512","Mechanical pencil Pentel PG1013-E GraphGear1000, line width 0.3 mm, rubber (Z2-1N), 1 piece","If You Want A Pencil, This Is THE One","labrat7357","As a student I write for hours each day, taking notes and doing tests. After using the GraphGear 1000 0.5mm for over a year, I can never go back to wood pencils or even other mechanical ones.It’s made almost completely from metal, and it’s enjoyable to write with.The retractable sleeve is extremely convenient because when I’m in a rush I can toss the pencil in my pocket and not worry about it bending.Another unique thing about this pencil is that the clip has a spring so it’s easy to use.When writing for a long time it feels top-heavy, but the weight is also positive because it leads to a smoother writing experience.The eraser is relatively small so I would recommend not using it and instead buy some block erasers (such as the Pentel Hi-Polymers ones which I love).One piece of advice for using the GraphGear: When you retract the tip, it uses quite a bit of force and I imagine it could possibly damage the pencil over time. I always cover the cap with my index finger so it can be let back slowly and gently.I’ve purchased 3 and given them as gifts to some of my friends.If I were to make any changes, I would get rid of the rubber on the grip. I love pencils & pens with just metal knurling, such as the Zebra F-xMD pen.I also like using the Kurutoga Roulette pencil, because it rotates and has a better grip. However, I prefer the GraphGear 1000 because the metal feels premium and the retractable tip prevents any bending.","Reviewed in Australia on 4 March 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They're a good weight and the grip is perfectly comfortable. They are not cheap but you pay for what you get. They're the best mech pencils I've ever used and I can't see me ever using any others.

Il est également facile de régler la sortie de la mine qui se fait petit à petit : on évite ainsi de l'avoir trop sortie ou risquer de la casser en voulant la faire rentrer un peu.Il est également possible de faire rentrer cette pointe par le biais d'un petit mécanisme qui est franchement pratique pour protéger les petites parties fragiles susceptibles de s'abîmer durant les transports, chutes ou autre.J'ai été étonné tout de même de découvrir le porte-mine seul dans une enveloppe à bulles, m'attendant à un minimum d'emballage et de protection, d'autant plus qu'il provient de l'étranger.

"517","Mechanical pencil Pentel PG1013-E GraphGear1000, line width 0.3 mm, rubber (Z2-1N), 1 piece","The best mechanical pencil you are likely to come across","Jens T.","In short: Fulfils all criteria to guarantee an excellent product experience.Looks: I have lost track of how many years I have had mine (best part of a decade now). They still look the business and are often asked about by my clients whilst I am using them. One was even stolen, so I suppose that makes them quite desirable.Construction: The retractable tip is just perfect. It has a slight springiness to it that not only cushions the writing/drawing experience, but also helps avoid lead breakages, although the modern hi-poly' refills are pretty good in their own right. Made principally of plastic and aluminium, it is light yet very robust. The combination of a knurled section and rubber grip is perfect - no readjustment or sweaty finger problems. There are no fancy gears that turn the lead around (as advertised by other products) neither have I ever thought to myself that I need one of those - one less unnecessary mechanism that can go wrong = minimalism = long-lasting = happy owner.Use: Always works well, very easy to carry around (very light). Solid enough construction to withstand severe punishment - mine has been submerged in water for ~3 days (flood while I was away) & dropped from a height of over 10m (~30ft) - accidentally dropped in the space between staircase - which obliterated the lead refills inside but the pen works just fine. If it was the cheaper plastics varieties of mechanical pencils then they would not have survived. I'm also sure that some of the more expensive varieties will not be able to boast this. Even if it did stop working, replacing them is not going to be too painful. As testament to how well these have worked, I now have 3 varieties of these that take different refill sizes, as well as a spare 0.5mm as my all-rounder when I have to jot down or explain anything on the go. The oldest one is pushing a decade in age and looks/works like new. [For the astute fans out there: yes, they did make minor changes in their construction over the years, but not to any detriment]Conclusion: I have never been let down, only pleasantly surprised. I would highly recommend this over any other product I have tried (including comparisons against other brands that are >4x more expensive). A fantastic product that offers excellent value and many years of great service. This product has never disappointed me and I'm certain that most will agree once they have had the pleasure of using it.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 May 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It's one you buy to keep; not use and dispose of. Undergraduate students looked at it with awe and respect (just kidding there- let's not get carried away).  It's very functional, but not the overt display of opulence of products made by jewelers.It writes very well, and has good balance.  The grip has that knurled surface that prevents it from slipping around when, for example, your hands are wet or dirty.  The action advancing the pencil leads is flawless..  Pencil leads can break when too much lateral pressure is applied, but it requires more than most other mechanical pencils.  The process of refilling leads is good.  No problems there.I like the design of that spring-loaded clip.  You ever find yourself upside-down when you didn't expect it?  It stays put in your shirtpocket or when clipped to your shirt's collar.After ~3-5 years I noticed some corrosion on the barrel of one i purchased.  This occurred after repeated exposure to humidity from being on the bathroom counter near the shower.  You wouldn't have that problem with plastic.  Some of the graphics looked weathered due to wear.  Could the black graphics be etched into the barrel?  Who knows how much a pencil like this would cost, however.The only weakness is that the eraser inside it (underneath the cap) tends to slide back when pressure is applied.  This doesn't happen with the eraser from the factory, but after I installed refills.  The eraser holding bracket just didn't grip enough (anymore) after installing refill erasers.  And so the eraser didn't stay put;' making erasure difficult and frustrating.  I know it's my own fault, with big Trump-like hands.  After putting in a new eraser, I couldn't re-form that bracket exactly again.  I believe that some writers might never use that eraser, opting instead for a separate one.Overall, a great product for those who need better than just a cheap throwaway pencil.","Reviewed in Australia on 4 March 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

This pencil provides a 'modernized' experience if you have already experienced the old Pentel mechanical pencils. These days, there are tons of feature packed pencils such as Kuru Toga, DelGuard, etc. But this pencil doesn't have such fashionable features while really good at what it has been good at: the solid writing experience.The lead sleeve retraction feature is a nice and unexpected to have in a Pentel product. But it really helps when you need to be mobile. My decade long gripe on Pentel P20X series was the lead pipe bending like crazy if it was handled wrong way which happens a lot in a classroom environment. Moreover, I usually preferred 0.3mm version due to my note taking habit.The rubberized pads on textured metal grip is unexpectedly comfy to grip. It's not as comfortable as the Dr. Grip but at least metal grip does not attract so much dust unlike rubber surface grips.There is almost nothing to gripe.. A bit heavy? maybe? I do not have problem with such weight since I usually prefer writing with ebonite fountain pens with piston mechanism. So, I'm kind of used to heavy writing apparatus. But if you're not really a fan of heavy writing instruments, it might be problematic.

The pencil is well constructed, strong, practical, good grip and it fits fine in your hand when in use. I wouldn't say that it would be the best for writing as the lead is so fine, I would say that 0.5 and upwards would be best for that task. Having used Pentel standard plastic mechanical pencils for years I thought I would treat myself to something more stylish and long lasting and all I required was built into the GraphGear 1000. Well worth the money and when I purchased it, it had a fair discount on the RRP.Now looking at a GraphGear fine point pen as I am impressed with the pencil.","Reviewed in Canada on 8 September 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Tengo uno de esos lapiceros ""desechables"" de Pentel, y me ha durado ya como 2 años.Este es uno de esos que si veo en una tienda nunca compraría, pero por internet si que dan ganas...Así que me lo compre, y tengo varias cosas que decir sobre este:-Para empezar, no viene empaquetado, simplemente viene envuelto en papel de burbujas. Algo preocupante, pero el mio llego en perfectas condiciones.-Al tenerlo en la mano por primera vez, te das cuenta de lo pesado que es, algo molesto al inicio, pero a la larga te acostumbras.-La punta es retráctil, la palanquita que tiene en el cuerpo sirve para retraerla, se nota la calidad de esta. No parece que se vaya a romper por nada.-El apoyo donde van los dedos se siente extraño, no voy a mentir, pero cumple su función como grip.-Las puntas incluidas son bastante buenas, algo mas suaves para mi gusto, pero he de admitir su calidad.En resumen, bastante bonito a la vista, al principio parece raro, pero a la larga te acostumbras.Yo lo uso para dibujar, pero para escribir es bastante mejor, creo yo.","Reviewed in India on 4 April 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I have tried many other options, some for much more money, but I have continuously come back to this. The design is just so perfect. It feels sturdy without being too heavy and the built in practicality is unmatched. The eraser is nothing to write home about but in an emergency it does the job and can be easily replaced when it runs out. The tip stability is excellent and the feeling ot the grip is surprisingly nice considering it's just metal and rubber dots. I do with that the dots weren't this tacky blue color, the Grey on the .5 is much more subtle and astetically pleasing. But the writing and usage experience is superb. I particularly like how the clip goes into the pencil while it's extended so that there is no protruding metal on the barrel while writing. These are so nice that I have collected quite a few to give as gifts to people.The one problem with this listing in particular is the very sub par shipping. They literally just throw the pencil without a case into a bag and ship it. I wouldn't be surprised if some of these ended up arriving damaged because of that but all of the ones that I've ordered have been fine.","Reviewed in Mexico on 31 July 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Prior to this pencil I was using a Bic mechanical pencil, one of the 12 or so in a package. Probably a dollar per pencil or less.I write a lot every day, and I developed sore muscles in many regions of my hand, so I decided it was time I invest in myself and purchase a “higher-end” pencil, one that was smooth to write with and comfortable to hold.I looked at many pencils from the range of 15-50$ Canadian, this one sat at 18 dollars I believe for the 0.5mm. I liked the look, read some reviews and most of them were quite positive so I decided to try this one out.The case It comes in is nothing special, but it is a case for a single mechanical pencil, and by no means is it poor. It’s cheap as hopefully most of the 18$ was put into the main man himself, the pencil.Now the pencil itself has a nice weight to it, when I clicked the back end and the front tip shot out I was mad excited to try. Very smooth writing, massive improvement over my previous pencils. I’m gliding on my pages and my writing is a lot clearer.Also clicking on the clip will snap the front tip back into its slot. Pretty neat function but we’ll see how it lasts through the test of time.As for my hand and muscle soreness, I’m feeling a huge decrease in pain after just two days of use with this pencil.For its price, and the amount I write, its seeming like a very smart purchase.","Reviewed in Spain on 4 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"564","Derwent Graphic Soft Graphite Drawing Pencils, Ideal For Illustrating & Shading, Set Of 12, Professional Quality, 34215","Derwents are some of the best around","Mz Nina, business consultant and aspiring artist","I looove this brand, also all their colored pencil lines.  I know everyone is Prismacolor crazy, but it is hype.  Derwents are just as good and I am a little partial to them simply they are the ones I learn to draw with even as a kid.  I remember my first Derwent kit that Dad bought me, 120 pencils and I was around 8 and we were livi9ng in Australia.I love the water color pencils, the graphite, the ink tense that you can actually draw on fabric with and it stays, and the color soft line.  I also have a few others, but those are my favorites.I would say there pencils are as good as any other including Prismacolor.Just make sure to get the right pencil sharpener no matter what you use.  Get a Derwent battery operated, which is still made or a Panasonic or a used HUNT-Boston, all of which are no longer made.  DO NOT GET X-ACTO, it chews your pencils up and constantly breaks the lead.INFO ON ELECTRIC PENCIL SHARPENERS:I am a color pencil artist, and you need to have either a Panasonic, ""Hunt-Boston"" pencil sharpener, otherwise your colored pencils are eaten.  NEVER BUY X-ACTO for colored pencils, X-ACTO will eat your pencils.  Until you can find a Panasonic or Hunt-Boston, or Hunt or Boston electric pencil sharpener, get this if you can find one, or the Derwent ""BLACK"" model as it had 2 holes, one for a longer tip and one for a shorter tip.  I have both.  I had bought the Derwent one as I have Derwent but also use Prismacolor and graphite.  Panasonic and Hunt Boston are NO LONGER MADE no matter WHAT anyone says.  I was lucky to buy a new PANASONIC electric pencil sharpener by trolling the net until I found on.  Bought a used Boston, model #18, used on eBay and paid waaaay too much.  It was pretty beaten up.Also, if you do buy used, get one in the best quality that you can and just pay the extra, I would say up to $35.  I personally would not spend more than that.  I paid $38 for my new Panasonic.Also, X-ACTO bought out ""Hunt-Boston"" and all new models are a 4 digit model number, the actual ""Hunt-Boston"" is only a 2 digit.  This issue is that X-ACTO still sells under the Hunt Boston name, and it is misleading as it now uses X-ACTO cutters, which do NOTHING but EAT your pencils.  I also do not like it when someone lies about what they are selling.I bought what I thought was a ""HUNT"" electric pencil sharpener, it came in a box that had the Hunt name and packaging, but when I opened it up it was a, you guessed right...  An X-ACTO!!  Said so right on the sharpener.Bought on line here at Amazon from Overstock.com, but I returned it and got a refund, including shipping as they were misleading.Hope this helps with those of you who are colored pencil artist.  Get a PANASONIC, HUNT-BOSTON or Derwent sharpener.Also, run a graphite pencil through your sharpener first thing every day and it will stay sharp longer since colored pencils are waxy and tend to build up on the cutters.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 February 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Four stars for a couple of reasons: they were not packaged brilliantly so subjected to some force during delivery. This may result in the soft leads being broken inside the pencils, time will tell. Secondly, and this may seem a bit picky, the wave pattern on the bottom of each pencil doesn’t line up when in the tin and the name is pointing upwards. For an artist this is really frustrating and looks messy! You can either have a wave pattern going across the bottom of the tin nicely or the pencil names showing but not both. It’s really annoying but if things like that don’t bother you, you can’t go wrong with the actual pencils.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 June 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I thought maybe I just pressed lighter on the 8h, I continued with the rest of the pencils, and everything was perfect. So I did more comparisons of 8h and 9h with drawing lines, different shading, etc, and 9h is definitely darker than 8h, but whatever, I at least now know what to expect from both those pencils, probably just a lull in quality assurance that day.

"615","Faber-Castell - Castell 9000 Art Set Pencil (Pack of 6), Green","Good quality","elena.fornara","It’s a fact of life (and art) that if you want to do a decent drawing you need decent pencils (and decent paper). I’m just an amateur “hobby” artist who draws for pleasure but I’ve been doing it long enough to keep away from poor quality. The best pencils I’ve used are certainly the Blackwing range but their shading values are limited and if you want the full scope of hard and soft pencils you have to look elsewhere. I’ve used Derwent (they’re OK) and Tombow Mono (very good) but I was given this set of Faber-Castell 9000 and I thought I’d try them out for one detailed drawing. They are really good. I wanted a set that didn’t just concentrate on the B grades and this range goes from 5H to 5B which gives plenty of scope for light and dark shading. I found them nice to use, easy to blend and not scratchy (like cheaper options). Sharpening them with a scalpel was easy (no breakages) and I kept them pointed with some sandpaper. They really are nice drawing pencils. Most artists have their favourites (I like Mitsubishi Hi-Uni for the full range) and there will be Faber-Castell fans who wouldn’t draw with anything else. I’d certainly be happy to use these again.I see they’ve gone up in price. When I purchased this set from Amazon in March 2020 they cost £9.99 with free postage through the Prime system. That made them just 83p a pencil which was a bargain but I see the price has rocketed. Nevertheless they’re worth considering as an addition to your drawing tools.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 April 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"616","Faber-Castell - Castell 9000 Art Set Pencil (Pack of 6), Green","A bit confused.","A. Horner","I’ve used Faber Cattell water-soluble pencils for some time and I absolutely love them. The company also makes pencils with a very slight tint (blue, green and maybe others). These are called “Green” so not unreasonably I thought they were tinted. It turns out they’re normal graphite and Green seems to refer to a type (rather than colour) of pencil. They come in a green tin. On checking I see that my other FB pencils are in a green tin, so I didn’t get what I wanted. However, they’re an excellent pencil and I shall carry on using them, but I’m still looking for a green tint………","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 December 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"630","Faber-Castell - Castell 9000 Art Set Pencil (Pack of 6), Green","I Don't Know How I Learned Without Them","Tiziana Di Palma","I don't know why in the world I waited so long to buy some good drawing pencils! I have been sketching with whatever mechanical pencil I had in my bag for years with very little preference, but the way that my sketches have improved with these pencils has been dramatic! Now I feel comfortable creating full pieces of art in shades of grey, whereas before I would sketch lightly and then use other media to finish the piece. After ten years of sketching with, in retrospect, a highly inferior product, I feel confident that these are just what I needed to take the next step toward improvement.These are very high quality. They arrive sharpened, which is nice, since I'm used to colored pencils that arrive in dozens and take hours to sharpen. They sharpen well with a standard or high quality sharpener, and the graphite (even on the softer pencils) is strong enough to not crack in the barrel (a problem I had with some student grade pencils in high school art class). The case is nice, too, and has a soft matte-like finish to the touch. I imagine it will dent and prove less than perfect if thrust into a backpack pocket full of other materials, but if kept in between notebooks, it probably has a long life ahead of it.I bought a set for my best friend, and she is in love, too. This would make a great gift for any artist in your life, and is a good investment for your own arsenal of supplies if you are an artists as well.","Reviewed in the United States on 24 July 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Das gewählte Material vom Bleistift ist extrem robust. Dabei lässt sich die Mine dennoch leicht anspitzen.Der Bleistift hat den Härtegrad HB, eine Mindeststärke von 4,3 mm und ist vollständig ohne Holz versehen. Interessant finde ich, dass der Hersteller angibt, dass der ganze Bleistift kaubeständig ist. Ich kenne das aus meiner Schulzeit noch, dass ich das gerne gemacht habe, aber den Holzgeschmack nicht mochte.Fazit--------------------------------------------------Einen so robusten Bleistift hatte ich bisher noch nicht in der Hand. Zum Testen habe ich einen der 12 Bleistifte in der Mitte zerbrochen. Der Hersteller gibt an, dass durch das holzfreie Material das Produkt nicht splittert.

An der oberen Seite befindet sich ein kleiner Radiergummi, um kleine Korrekturen unmittelbar vornehmen zu können.Die Bleistifte liegen sehr gut in der Hand. Ich nutze sie überwiegend beim Lernen für mein Studium, um dort benötigte Zeichnungen anzufertigen (Graphen, Tabellen, etc.).Die Spitze des Bleistiftes ist sehr robust und hält lange. Auch nach dem Anspitzen bricht sie nicht direkt ab.Die Bleistifte sind kräftig, sodass man die gezogenen Linien, etc. auf Collegeblock Papier gut erkennen kann.Der Radiergummi ist für kleine Korrekturen sehr praktisch.Wenn man eine komplette Zeichnung radieren möchte, sollte man aber trotzdem zu einem größeren Radiergummi greifen.Zusammenfassend bin ich mit meinen neuen Bleistiften sehr zufrieden, da sie gut in der Hand liegen, kräftig und ergiebig sind, sowie einen kleinen Radiergummi enthalten.

"665","Bic - Evolution Triangle - Triangular Pencils with Integrated Eraser - HB - Box of 12","Im Grunde toll","Andreas","Die BIC Dreikant Bleistifte ""Evolution"" stellen erst auf den zweiten Blick eine neue Generation von Bleistiften dar.Das, was wie Holz aussieht, ist gar kein Holz, sondern Kunstharz.Den Unterschied spürt man weder beim Gebrauch, noch beim Spitzen, denn das ist alles wie gehabt.Die HB-Mine ist jedoch eine ganz normale Bleistiftmine von guter Qualität.Dass sie in der Kunstharzhülle besser geschützt ist, als in einer Holzhülle konnte ich bei normaler Verwendung nicht feststellen.Der Bleistiftköper ist mit blauem Metalliclack überzogen, sieht ganz schick aus.Am hinteren Ende befindet sich ein klassischer Aufsatz-Radiergummi in weiß. Wunder darf man von diesen Radiergummis nicht erwarten. Bei intensivem Gebrauch sind sie schnell aufgebraucht und nur noch die scharfkantige Blechhülle ist übrig und bei nur gelegentlichem Gebrauch verschmutzen und verfetten die Radiergummis und fangen an zu schmieren. Ich persönlich verwende stets einen ganz konventionellen Bleistift-Radiergummi in der gewohnten Riegelform.Trotzdem nur 4 Sterne, da mich im Angebotstext etwas wirklich stört.Da steht, dass beim Kauen auf dem Bleistift nichts absplittern kann.Also bitte. Man soll nicht auf dem Bleistift kauen! Und wer sich das wirklich nicht verkneifen kann, der ist mit einem nicht lackierten Echtholzbleistift bestimmt besser dran.Auf Kunstharz herumkauen? Wirklich??Wie auch immer, insgesamt ein ordentlicher Bleistift der seine erwartete Funktion hervorragend ausführt.","Reviewed in Germany on 18 November 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

She had one herself, but she wanted to take mine on a University trip which involved a lot of time out in the field. When she got back, she conveniently lost 'my' pencil and not her own (I had grounds to believe that it was actually her pencil she lost - which I was eventually proved right when she confessed to her crime).Anyway, the tension got so heated at one point that she bought me a new one right there on the spot. I should add that this argument went on for months. I simple wanted a confession. That's how much these mechanical pencils mean to us!With my second copy, we went the distance together. What makes these pencils so great is that they just have this perfect weight and feel. It genuinely feels like quality and it's rare to find all of the graphite broken inside. You can really hit the darker tones of the HB quite effortlessly while being just as able to be used lightly and for speed taking notes.I used my first copy back when I was at University. I had to do a lot of technical drawings of architecture or infrastructure and I can honestly say that it always allowed me to deliver the quality of drawing that I had in mind. My second copy was mostly used for a lot of note-taking and the occasional drawing.My new copy, as displayed in the photograph, is mostly unused for now. I only bought this particular ASIN because it came with the additional graphite. This is only a couple of quid more expensive than just buying the supplies individually - so I figured why not have a backup!In any case, I am prepared this time if my Sister plans on another heist...","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 September 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Its particularly strong features are its lead feed mechanism - which is firm and has never given me any trouble - and the comfortable rubberised grip towards the bottom of the barrel. For what it's worth, the pencil's appearance is distinctive too, and the metal pocket grip doesn't detach itself.I don't remember when I bought my first Staedtler, but think it must have been at least six years ago. I still have it, and have just bought three more, not because of any problems with the original, but because I have gradually lost some others that I had for different places, different pockets, etc.The leads that come with the pencil - sadly only three as a starter - are superior to own-brand replacements from stationery chains. So I have gone back to paying Staedtler's price for 12 
  
Staedtler Mars Micro Carbon 0.5mm HB Mechanical Pencil Lead







  
  
    , which is not much less than at least one chain's price for 40. Even in experienced hands (mine), the latter break frequently; if someone borrows the pencil they get frustrated because the cheap leads break repeatedly. Staedtler leads mostly don't.So yer pays yer money and yer makes yer choice - mine's a Staedtler.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 August 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

C'est lui qui, il y a plus de 40 ans, m'a fait connaître les produits de cette marque.Je n'ai utilisé que des gommes de cette marque (à l'école comme à la maison) , des crayons à papier et porte-mine steadler. Désormais je continue à en acheter et pour ma fille de 7 ans, après avoir testé une marque magasin, je suis vite revenue à cette marque qui fait un excellent travail. Crayonnage, gommage et coloriages.... Je ne peux que recommander cette marque quelque soit le produit.J'ai acheté ce porte-mine sans me soucier d'une possible mésaventure et j'en suis ravie. Je n'ai aucun soucis.Les mines 0,5mm sont effectivement fines mais c'est ce que l'on recherche.Certaines, neuves, semblent effectivement ne pas faire le bon diamètre et sortent seules sur une partie de la mine.... Un défaut à la conception peut-être ?Ça ne me dérange pas. Je vais d'ailleurs acheter la version 0.7 (les miens ayant été depuis longtemps égarés après plusieurs déménagements.)Je recommande ce produit !Il fonctionne parfaitement et c'est plutôt la gomme qui s'use dans le temps.... J'ai d'ailleurs fait des recherche avec la référence des recharges, nom de la marque etc sans succès et c'est en posant la question que j'ai pu avoir le lien en moins de 24h pour les recharges de gommes par la marque !

Me gustó tanto que he repetido la compra. He de decir que la anterior la cambié porque me cayó y la pisé sin querer. Anteriormente había utilizado de Rotring que aunque no es mala, no tiene la punta retráctil y finalmente la goma de agarre se acabó rompiendo poco a poco en pedacitos. También tuve una Faber-Caster de punta retráctil que es bastante similar a la Staedler.Ésta tiene un agarre firme y ergonómico, con goma suave en la punta. Al escribir, no resbala ni gira.En mi caso, tengo la mala costumbre de hacer demasiada fuerza al escribir por lo que las minas de 0,5 las devoro, teniendo que usar en una lapicera normal minas de 0,7 mm. Con ellas el trazo para escritura en mi opinión queda demasiado ancho y ensucia mucho el papel. Gracias a portaminas como esta y su punta retráctil, puedo utilizar minas de 0,5 porque ese movimiento de muelle que tiene en la punta absorbe la fuerza que hago de más.Otra cosa que debo decir es que, si tienes la técnica de girar la lapicera a la vez que vas escribiendo para ir afilando la mina, con este portaminas puedes hacerlo de forma cómoda gracias al agarre simétrico que tiene.Así que estoy encantado con ella y si estás buscando un portaminas de calidad a un buen precio, yo no me lo pensaría más, es la tuya.","Reviewed in Spain on 29 December 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"721","STAEDTLER 7755ABK25D Mars Micro Mechanical Pencil, 0.5mm (Blistercard of 1 + 12 HB Lead Refills)","Loved it so much I bought it twice!","Morgane A","Absolutely loved this mechanical pencil, I sadly lost the original one and didn't need to think twice before buying a second one. (I found the first one so now I have two!)The quality is great and the lead is strong but not too brittle. The pencil is not as dark as other HB pencils, which isn't really a problem for me as I use it for technical drawings rather than shading. After about a years use the silver painting on my pencil began to wear away, but that is the only difference between this one and my old one.My only problem with the product is the lead refill. The price of the product is great as the refill on its own is a good percentage of the price of the pen with the refill included. However the little tube the lead is in is not very secure. I left it in a small pencil case and after a few weeks the lid had fallen out and my refills had all been smashed to pieces. I was a little disappointed by this as I had been using cheap lead refills when doing sketches and using the staedtler lead sparingly, and as mentioned before the refills on their own are quite expensive, but worth it considering how many other wooden pencils I would have gone through had I not switched to mechanical.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 June 2017","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Da ich bei Schreiben den Stift nicht genau senkrecht sondern etwas schräg halte, nutzt sich die Mine natürlich auch schräg ab, was zu einer dickeren Schrift führt. Bei 0,7mm wurde das schnell unordentlich. Mit dieser Mine ist es aber genau richtig.Der Stift ist gut verarbeitet und liegt auch gut in der Hand. Wichtiges Kaufargument war für mich aber auch der Preis, der hier viel niederiger lag als im Geschäft.

"851","Faber-Castell Grip Plus Set 130997 Mechanical Pencil-Assorted Color","Por no más de 7-10 €, un portaminas de gama media-baja fiable, versátil, cómodo y elegante.","Alejandro","Por mecanismo interno, tengo desde hace años un primo de este, el Grip 2011 también en 0,7 mm.  Con tan buena opinión de este Grip Plus quería tenerlo y probarlo a buen precio.Lo que digo en el título lo cumple. Es un portaminas con buena prestancia pese a ser de plástico (hasta el clip), y se siente estupendamente en la mano. También tiene pinta metálica (como si fuera la de un bolígrafo) retráctil  y con amortiguación para proteger la mina de rotura (como todos los Grip).Pero es mejorable.No hay que pagar en exceso por él, pues es un portaminas muy de plástico, llegando incluso al mecanismo interno (el embrague y garras que sujetan y gestionan el avance de la mina son en plástico, no de latón).  Está fabricado en Japón, lo que es una garantía.Y por esto último es mejorable.  Este portaminas tiene varios primos-hermanos bajo diferentes marcas con leves diferencias estéticas.  Por lo que tengo entendido, el diseño base y general lo fabrica el grupo Kotobuki ('Kotobuki Group').  Varios de sus primos (de los que por las normas, no mencionaré marcas ni modelos) optan por ejemplo por un clip metálico, que creo que es más conveniente para este estilo de portaminas, y lo haría más duradero (no obstante el Grip 2011, o el más delgado y también de fabricación japonesa, Grip 1345, tienen clips metálicos).  Cuidad del de plástico, que son más propensos a romper.Viene envuelto en un par de bolsitas de plástico transparente, una de ellas hermética del tipo 'zip'.  Quizás algo escaso de protección. También viene cargado con 5 minas de la casa, creo que en dureza 2B.  Blandas, muy suaves, y bastante apropiadas para escribir con estos portaminas aprovechando el contar con la mina amortiguada ante excesos de presión contra el papel.Los colores son preciosos, por otros productos de la casa que comparten los de este modelo, lo sé.  No decepcionará ninguno, todos muy elegantes y aptos para toda ocasión y uso.  Y este rojo granate tampoco es la excepción, le queda espectacular.Pese a los puntos mejorables, no obstante, es bastante recomendable.  Es normal que tenga buena fama.  Así que si te hace tilín y está a buen precio o quieres darte el capricho, aprieta el gatillo.

I happened to see these Faber-Castell pencils online and was intrigued by the photo.  I bought the blue, red, and blackberry with .7mm lead.  These pencils are definitely a step up in quality.  They are engineered with a superior ergonomic grip, a long twist-up eraser, and very stable tip.  The lead that came with them has just the right hardness and writes smoothly.  I like the larger diameter of the pencil, and the thin band of metal that is visible above the grip is a nice visual accent.  The colored barrels are plastic but the pencil has sufficient weight from the lower metal portion.","Reviewed in the United States on 26 September 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Es ligero, ergonómico (el agarre en la zona de goma es ideal) y de calidad. El grosor 0.7 es ideal al ser algo mas resistente la mina y disponer una amortiguación por muelle, ambas características facilitan algo mas de presión para los subrayados y los trazos más nítidos en la escritura en diferencia de un grosor menor con 0.5. Si no te importa el detalle del color (te envían un color aleatorio, no se puede elegir) por el mismo coste de un solo portaminas, obtienes también un respuesto de goma y minas B. Lleva en su blister cerrado perfecto. A mi parecer es una genial opción de compra.

Lo uso para dibujo artístico, para escribir, para tomar apuntes..para cualquier cosa. Pensé que no me serviría para dibujar puesto que las misnas pone que son HB, pero son bastante blanditas y puedes hacer con ellas lo que quieras. Difícil de partir también.Al ser portaminas con goma, las gomitas son pequeñas, pero por unos 3€ en Amazon podéis compraros un recambio con 3 formas extra. Duran muchísimo así que merecen la pena. Borran fenomenal y es comodísimo escribir, y solo dando la vuelta al portaminas, borrar en segundos el fallo que hayas cometido. Porque borran realmente bien!Faber Castell nunca decepciona y el precio de este portaminas en concreto (comparados con otros de la misma marca o incluso de otras mucho peores en calidad...) es muy bueno!Si el otro día me compré uno del mismo tipo (por capricho) marca Milán en el bazar chino de mi casa y además de que ya se me ha roto la tapa de la goma (este modelo traía tapón para el borrador) las minas son durísimas, se parten a la mínima presión, la goma si borra bien, eso es cierto, y me costó 3€!! Éste me costó 6!No recomendaría otro, a no ser que lo queráis para dibujo técnico, que entonces hay otros más especificos....Ah! Parece que es gordito y va a ser incomodo al uso, pero para nada. Es ergonómico y se adapta perfectamente a la escritura/bibujo o para bocetos incluso. También puedes comprar después recambios de minas de la dureza que quieras, así que no le veo ningún contra.","Reviewed in Spain on 7 June 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"931","Faber-Castell Grip Plus Set 130997 Mechanical Pencil-Assorted Color","Perfekt für mich","Nina2401","Der Druckbleistift von Bic gefällt mir viel besser als die bisher benutzten normalen Bleistifte. Das ist zum einen das feine Schriftbild, das ich konstant erzeugen kann, in dem ich den Bleistift immer mal wieder drehe. Spitzen ist natürlich nicht erforderlich und wenn ich mich mal verschrieben habe, kann ich das blitzschnell mit dem integrierten Radiergummi korrigieren. Wenn man diesen vorsichtig herausdreht, finde man auch die beiden Ersatzminen.Durch einfaches Drücken wird die Mine weiter herausgeschoben und bleibt dann auch draußen. Zurück kann man sie nicht drücken, wenn man zu oft gedrückt hat, bedeutet das eine weit herausstehende Mine, die man dann vorsichtig runterschreiben sollte. Deshalb finde ich die Stifte für unterwegs nicht so gut geeignet. An der Seite befindet sich ein Clip, damit kann ich den Stift sehr gut an meinem Block befestigen.Ich habe die Stifte in 2 verschiedenen Minenstärken ausprobiert, kann da jetzt aber keine gravierenden Unterschiede feststellen. In beiden Stärken kann ich sehr fein schreiben.Ich werde die Stifte definitiv nachkaufen, aber das wird noch lange dauern, denn selbst ein Vielschreiber wie ich wird ewig mit den Stiften auskommen.","Reviewed in Germany on 24 May 2018","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"954","Faber-Castell Grip Plus Set 130997 Mechanical Pencil-Assorted Color","The last pencil you’ll need","Fabrizio","Ho utilizzato la matita in questione (rotring 800 mina 0,7) per un paio di settimane al lavoro tutto il giorno come unico strumento di scrittura e disegno (oltre che a casa per diletto o per prendere qualche appunto a caso) e quindi mi sento pronto a dare un mio parere. Sono un impiegato tecnico (ingegnere civile) in uno studio di ingegneria, quindi per una cosa o per l'altra in studio scrivo o faccio qualche schizzo prettamente a matita, per abitudine soprattutto, ma è per dire che ho modo di usarla molto la matita. L'oggetto in questione è costruito in modo impeccabile, veramente bella ed elegante e trasmette veramente solidità, più di quanto mi aspettassi. Il meccanismo di estrazione della punta funziona bene, l'estrazione della mina per esigenze costruttive non è la più appagante che abbia mai provato (ma va benissimo) e il tutto funzione senza incertezze. La cosa che più mi spaventava era il peso, perchè gia in passato passando dal classico porta mine economico di plastica a questi in metallo il limite che alla fine mi aveva fatto tornare ai primi è il peso, che con un uso intenso dopo un pò stanza veramente. In questo caso, seppur la matita non sia sicuramente leggera, anzi, il fatto che si riesca a impugnare molto vicino alla punta fa si che non si percepisca molto il suo peso in mano e quindi devo dire che alla fine non mi stanca particolarmente nella scrittura (nel disegno di solito si avverte meno la cosa per il movimento più lento). Riguardo al presunto problema del puntale che traballa nella sua sede essendo estraibile devo dire che durante l'utilizzo veramente bisogna impegnarsi sul serio per riuscire a percepire qualcosa, per me non sussiste proprio come impedimento, anche se sicuramente rispetto alla sua sorella inore con punta fissa o a una qualsiasi altra matita meccanica senza punta estraibile se si va a giocare col dito sulla punta non trasmette la stessa fermezza dell'elemento. In conclusione devo dire che sono soddisfatto della matita, sono contento di essermi levato questo sfizio, perchè di sfizio si tratta, dato che il prezzo è sicuramente elevato se pensiamo che è una matita meccanica e non è che rispetto a quelle da 5 euro vadda chissà quanto meglio, si scrive pressoché uguale, l'unica differenza è la piacevole sensazione che ragala come strumento più esclusivo e di estetica e dato che la amtita la uso tutto il giorno volevo togliermi lo sfizio di averne una che mi piacesse tanto.","Reviewed in Italy on 28 July 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Personally, this is a pro and makes it feel like a quality product.ConsYou may as well assume that this thing doesn’t come with an eraser, just a lead stopper.If you get a ding on the pencil, the paint will be removed and exposed the raw metal beneath (eye sore for perfectionists).Due to the heavy weight, this pencil is difficult to write quickly with or do pencil tricks with.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Die Präzision beim Schreiben ist beeindruckend, und die 0,7 mm Mine ermöglicht ein sauberes und genaues Schriftbild.Die Haptik des rOtring 800 ist erstklassig. Das Gewicht des Stifts liegt angenehm in der Hand, und die Griffigkeit ist perfekt.

Die schwarze Farbe verleiht ihm eine zeitlose Eleganz.Insgesamt bin ich äußerst zufrieden mit meinem Kauf und kann den rOtring 800 Druckbleistift allen empfehlen, die nach einem hochwertigen und präzisen Schreibinstrument suchen – vorausgesetzt, der Preis spielt keine allzu große Rolle.Unter anderen kann ich auch die Kugelschreiberversion dergleichen Linie ,dem ich auch in Besitz habe genauso bedenkenlos empfehlen.","Reviewed in Germany on 6 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

And the twist then click motion to begin writing is excessive.The 600’s tip doesn’t retract so it can easily be damaged if dropped or mishandled.I have what I believe is a Newton pencil… it only says ROTRING on the barrel and has a smooth, not checkered grip.

Truthfully, a $0.99 mechanical pencil is more reliable and lasts longer than this supposedly well-known product. It has been an absolute waste of time and money.

The negative reviews that say there is some tip wobble are way over blown on this aspect. There is a very little bit of wobble as there has to be in a moving part. This is consistent as I have several of these for my work. They all have the same amount of tip wobble.  Those reviewers who have such an issue with this aspect never actually discuss how the pencil performs tip wobble or not. In practice the minuscule tip wobble is simply not an issue. It is an outstanding pencil. I am an artist and use it all the time as well as the rOtring 600 and Graphgear 1000. These all have their strengths and purpose as do other pencils...even the wooden ones.

"975","Faber-Castell Grip Plus Set 130997 Mechanical Pencil-Assorted Color","The sliding collar tolerance is, unfortunately, abysmal.","Earl Kok","I really, really really wanted to like this pencil due to the retractable tip and ability to carry it around without worry. Unfortunately the amount of play in the tip is so great that it simply can't be ignored. I read a ton of reviews , watched loads of videos and bought this thinking that it can't be as bad as people made out in certain reviews but it unfortunately is.There is absolutely no reason why a pencil that clearly has top end machining and solidity elsewhere in the body has such an unacceptable amount of play in the KEY part of the pencil. To be clear, the part that extends and retracts has visible and very noticeable radial play between it and the section it slides up and down in to the point that it audibly clacks when you're writing with it. It should be approaching an interference fit and be absolutely solid as a fixed tip for something that costs as much as it does.It's current lax production format may be fine for casual writers and people coming to it green with few expectations or less demanding technical/precision needs but when you compare it to its fixed tip sibling, the 600, or the literal solid and precise, bones of your hand extension that the Pentel P205 is and writes like (still in my humble opinion the greatest mechanical pencil on the planet today), the difference is night and day.Can't recommend this at all and if you're thinking about it, I'd say buy the 600 in the tip diameter you want without any worries and buy yourself another four P205s with the money saved and fit a variety of different hardness leads in them for fun and variety. You'll be infinitely happier and better equipped in day to day pencil options.Sorry Rotring. For this to be your flagship pencil, you really should be doing better. Either sort your sliding mechanism tolerances out or add a sexy screw on cap to the 600, charge a fiver more for it and dump the 800.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Also looking at the photos I thought the gold accents looked cheap. In person this pencil looks anything but cheap. The gold, black and red is truly nice together. The Rotring 800 looks like a quality instrument. When you pick it up and start to write it’s even better. The mechanism that extends the sleeve has a satisfied spring. The pencil is well balanced and nicely weighted. One of the main concerns people have with the 800 is the sleeve. There is a little bit of movement. This is true but not enough for me to complain. I work in the interior design industry and hand draw floor plans for carpets, rugs and furniture. I also take notes and write quotes with the Rotring. That little bit of movement has not affected my experience with the pencil. I need to be able to carry the pencil in my shirt pocket or planner as well.

And some of that will lead you to a lot of people saying that the retractable Rotring has a slight tip wobble (because it's moving parts). I've been using this daily for  over a year now and it's still going strong. I'm a massive fidgetter so I'm constantly popping the nib in and out and taking the rubber protector on and off and it's still not gotten to a point where it's worn or damaged. This is my favourite pencil. It weighs a really nice amount for me and feels like a good bit of kit.The improvements I think it could do with are minor. The first is the little tab thing that you slide it onto shirt pockets and what not. I think this should not be painted. This area is the one that gets the most wear and naturally the paint chips. It'd made more sense to plain finish it. The second is the availability of the rubbers. The rubbers last ages but they are a little difficult to pickup, in the end I opted to go for the ones direct from their site because they are a special size and didn't want to get the wrong ones.Besides that though I really like the pencil. I'd definitely recommend it if you are looking to upgrade to a something proper.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 March 2019","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

(on certain angles it is not)The push button on 800 is hard and also jiggly due to having a little extra room for lead sleeve parts.I like the 600's material better.The lead sleeve of 600 always is out and sharp and fragile.So, if you do not drop your pencil a lot (and break the sleeve lead of 600) and if you have a pencil casethen 600 is good.","Reviewed in the United States on 3 April 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"996","Faber-Castell Grip Plus Set 130997 Mechanical Pencil-Assorted Color","Pencil has serious quality issues","Steven Black","I love Rotring pencils.  In general they are essentially the best drafting pencils around, both the Rotring Rapid Pro and the Rotring 600 are simply superb.  Having said all this it pains me to have to leave a negative review on the Rotring 800, but what can I say?  It is simply a bad product that is ridiculously overpriced.  Rotring touts the 800 as their cream of the crop mechanical pencil and it has a nifty twist mechanism, which pops in and out and makes the pencil pocket friendly by removing the sharp point.  And yes this twist mechanism does work; however, when you try to write with the pencil you will notice a lot of play in the metal tip.  Folks a mechanical drafting pencil is suppose to be precise.  Having a loose tip defeats the whole purpose of precise writing.  The pencil does look quite attractive, however; that is why it gets two stars.  Otherwise it is complete garbage.  If you want a high quality drafting pencil then buy either the Rotring Rapid Pro or the Rotring 600.  If you want a pocket safe pencil then get the Rapid Pro.  If you are not worried about the sharp point then buy the legendary Rotring 600.","Reviewed in the United States on 9 May 2015","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"998","Faber-Castell Grip Plus Set 130997 Mechanical Pencil-Assorted Color","Disappointing after the 600","Eduardo Alvarez","Like many others, it chomps lead in 2cm pieces- constant frustrating breaking. The only way to lessen this is to use harder lead (which I don't like) and not retract the nib (which was the whole point in buying it)- but still it happens occasionally. The mechanism seems to pinch the lead too hard unlike the 600. The broken pieces are always the same length. I have a massive collection of them. I went back to the 600 and it felt like the leads were lasting forever. The 800 is poor effort for the huge price. (I cannot sing the praises of the 600 enough though- beautiful in every way- except to transport with fragile pointy nib; I wish they would just have a lid!)","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 May 2016","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Non conoscevo inizialmente questo marchio, però informandomi e provandole personalmente mi sono accorto di quanto siano di qualità. Non solo vengono consigliati a chi studia nelle accademie di belle arti, ma hanno una qualità costruttiva eccezionale. La linea Academy permette di creare sfumature di vario genere, senza rovinare troppo il foglio. Il tratto non è troppo pesante e non necessita di grande pressione per poterci disegnare. La matita in se è di ottima qualità. Non appena riceverete la confezione a casa, vi troverete davanti ad una scatola di metallo molto comoda e resistente, con all'interno un set di colori da 24, ideali per dei disegni con non troppe sfumature. Se volete semplicemente disegnare su carta, vi consiglio di acquistare queste per il prezzo più basso, altrimenti puntate su altre linee sempre della Derwent.","Reviewed in India on 12 October 2022","2.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They replaced the specific colours I was having issues with and, though not professional quality (obviously), I have a set of consistent pencils that are actually useful and worth the money. Thank you Derwent for the excellent customer service!**Having used and enjoyed Derwent grahite pencils for some time, I had enough confidence in the brand buy this set of coloured pencils. OK, I knew they were the 'academy' ones, and that they wouldn't be as good as the more professional choice.However, the quality of some of the pencils renders the set virtually useless for more than just basic 'colouring in'.Firstly, the colours of some pencils are questionable - the 'deep red' is not significantly different from the 'red', the 'light blue' is a good deal darker than the 'blue' the 'lime green' and 'acid yellow' are pretty similar and the black is nothing more than a dark gray.Secondly is how the pencils lay down pigment. With some of the pencils they hardly lay down any colour at all. with the purple pencil you feel like you're tearing through the paper just to get some colour on the page. same with 'rose'and blue.Finally, they don't blend all that well. Some colours do, but a lot simply do not. Same thing with burnishing.Having used more expensive pencils in the past, I'd recommend that you don't cut corners, and just go straight to professional grade pencils. You'll have a lot more fun, create more vibrant art, and be a whole lot less frustrated in the process.This purchase feels a lot like £15 wasted.","Reviewed in Spain on 22 October 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1060","Faber-Castell 111260 Colour Pencils (Pack of 60),3.5 x 18.6 x 21 cm; 399.16 Grams","Wish I had found these first","CRISTINA T.","These might be a ""middle"" quality pencil but they are nice. (Note of thanks to those who do coloring books, you seem to be driving the price down and the quality up from the ""student"" grade.)They lay down smooth even colors that are as bright or as light as you want (pressure on the pencil).  The hexagonal shape makes them easier to use for longer times than the round pencils. The core does not break, at least I have not broken one yet.Compared to Prismacolor Primer, they are bolder colors, lay down smother, and actually blend much better.  (Possibly due to FC's use of veggie oil instead of wax?)So far I've only used them with the Prismacolors to get the detail and wet fresh paint look quicker. So for those who know color pencils, this does in one pass what the Prismacolors does in 4 or 5.  I've used them to get a color that I don't have in the Prisma set.  They also have some interesting colors not common in other sets (gold, silver, copper). I think I will use the Prisma's as an underpainting and then lay these down on top for that finished look.My only complaint is that there is a consistency problem.  Some colors, notably the lighter ones, do not perform the same way the darker colors do.  The light colors seem to be a much harder core.  That means more passes.Also 48 colors is fairly limited. (Not a complaint, just an observation for the serious artist.)For the money I'm very happy with these and wish I had found them first.","Reviewed in France on 26 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They blend beautifully and the assortment is very good.  I've never had a core break and they sharpen to a fine point in my Staedtler hand held sharpener.  The only thing I have a problem with is getting real depth with the black pencil.  Fortunately, it isn't a pencil I use often.  Probably when I am more used to coloured pencils, I'll figure it out.

"1073","Faber-Castell 111260 Colour Pencils (Pack of 60),3.5 x 18.6 x 21 cm; 399.16 Grams","Colour blending","Caroline","The last colour pencil I had was twenty years ago, and it was a set of 48 colour pencils from other brand. This is a huge increase in terms of the choice of colours, which is a luxury, and at the same time, new experience. Please note, I have only tried those colours in blue. Here are my thoughts: (1) some of the colours blend in very well with each other, even up to four colours of blue blend in with each other as if it is natural.(2) not every colour blend, some stand up as it's own and can never be blended with others. I assume these are best for the ""light"" as shown in the pictures. It stands alone, so you don't need to worry these colours will get ""intruded"" by others.(3) there are some -to my surprise - has some shinny powder incorporated into the colour, the idea behind is really nice, as they are supposed to ""reflect and shine"" on the paper. However, pressure on these colours will actually reveal a dark-greyish colour instead of luxury reflective colour. Do note that I am still getting a hold on these colours, my impression on these new shine powder incorporated into colour pencils might change over time.Overall I am satisfied, and please note: never let the colour pencils fall from the table, the colour breaks instantly.Updates:Drew the last picture, and I am actually quite satisfied with the performance of the color pencil. Those few pencil with shiny powder incorporated can never be used to blend with other colors, but it has its own specialty and perhaps I might able to use them one day in some special things.","Reviewed in Sweden on 21 October 2021","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Die Stiftenden sind gerade abgeschnitten und unlackiert.Die Minen zerbrechen kaum und lassen sich sehr gut anspitzen. Ein Übereinanderlegen von mehreren Farbschichten ist ebenfalls gut möglich. Radieren lassen sie sich gut mit einem weichen weißen oder transparenten Radierer.Von der Farbzusammenstellung her sind es kräftige Farben, die sich vor allem für den Schulunterricht eignen dürften. Gedeckte Farbtöne hingegen zum Zeichnen von naturalistischen Landschaften, Pflanzen, Tieren, Portraits etc. fehlen bis auf gedecktes Olivgrün. Ansonsten sind alle Farben klar, kräftig und leuchtend. Es gibt keine doppelten Farbtöne. Dazu kommen 5 Metallic-Stifte in Violett, Mittelblau, Blaugrün, Gold und Silber, die einen ganz dezenten Schimmer haben.Farbzusammenstellung: wenige Gelb- und Orangetöne, sehr viele Rot- und Pinktöne, eine gute Auswahl an Blautönen, eine auf den ersten Blick etwas unharmonische Auswahl an Grüntönen, eine gute Auswahl an Brauntönen und zwei Grautöne. Dazu Weiß und Schwarz. Das Weiß kann man zum Malen auf dunklem Papier verwenden, zum Setzen von Glanzlichtern auf anderen Farben eignet es sich nicht, da es nicht stark genug pigmentiert ist. Wenn man die Grüntone nach Farbnuancen (gelblich, bläulich, bräunlich) und nach Helligkeitsstufen ordnet, ergibt die Auswahl Sinn.Die Minen sind von der Härte her alle gleichermaßen weich bis auf ein helles Gelbgrün und Ocker. Diese beiden Stifte sind in meiner Packung schwächer pigmentiert und deutlich härter.Die leichte Kartonage ist wahrscheinlich nur zum Verkauf und Versand gedacht, nicht zur dauerhaften Aufbewahrung. Der Aufsteller aus dünnem Karton ist standhaft und geschmackvoll.Einzelstifte kann man nicht nachkaufen. Eine Farbkarte des Herstellers gibt es auch nicht.Merkwürdig ist, dass Faber-Castell in denselben roten Verpackungen, gleichgültig ob Kartonage oder Metallkasten, zwei verschiedene Qualitäten vermarktet: Neben der oben beschriebenen eher weichen Qualität auch noch eine weitere, die eher härtere Minen besitzt, keine Farbnummern und kein Namensfeld hat und auch etwas dünner lackiert ist. Wenn man eine Packung kauft, weiß man nicht, welche Qualität man bekommt.Fazit: sehr gute Stifte für Kinder und Jugendliche zu einem hervorragenden Preis, ansprechend aufzubewahren im  Karton-Aussteller. Die  Farbauswahl sollte vom Hersteller einmal etwas überarbeitet werden, dann können sie auch von Erwachsenen gut benutzt werden (weniger Rot- und Pinktöne, mehr Gelb- und Orangefarben, ein Creme-Farbton und ein stark pigmentiertes Weiß). Ein Nachkauf von Einzelstiften anhand der Farbnummern auf der Webseite des Herstellers wäre wünschenswert, ebenso eine ausdruckbare Farbkarte. Des Weiteren sollte sich der Hersteller einmal für EINE Qualität, vorzugsweise für die weichere, entscheiden.","Reviewed in the Netherlands on 17 September 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I am very happy with them. I'm no expert, but they are not on the ""waxy"" side. I was looking for something less waxy, so these are good for my uses. They blend ""ok."" I used them on regular paper (adult colouring book style) as well as on a canvas, like for painting. Paper was very good. On the canvas they were really nice, and the only thing I'd say to be wary of is that they smudge very easily. I imagine waxy ones would smudge less. So I like the finished product, but just beware of smudging. I'm going to look for some kind of spray on plastic coating to protect my masterpiece ;-) from smudging. I will definitely go with Faber-Castell again, and now that I know what to expect I will invest in a bigger set to get more colour options.","Reviewed in the United States on 24 January 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1114","Derwent Graphic Soft Graphite Drawing Pencils, Ideal For Illustrating & Shading, Set Of 12, Professional Quality, 34215","Derwents are some of the best around","Mz Nina, business consultant and aspiring artist","I looove this brand, also all their colored pencil lines.  I know everyone is Prismacolor crazy, but it is hype.  Derwents are just as good and I am a little partial to them simply they are the ones I learn to draw with even as a kid.  I remember my first Derwent kit that Dad bought me, 120 pencils and I was around 8 and we were livi9ng in Australia.I love the water color pencils, the graphite, the ink tense that you can actually draw on fabric with and it stays, and the color soft line.  I also have a few others, but those are my favorites.I would say there pencils are as good as any other including Prismacolor.Just make sure to get the right pencil sharpener no matter what you use.  Get a Derwent battery operated, which is still made or a Panasonic or a used HUNT-Boston, all of which are no longer made.  DO NOT GET X-ACTO, it chews your pencils up and constantly breaks the lead.INFO ON ELECTRIC PENCIL SHARPENERS:I am a color pencil artist, and you need to have either a Panasonic, ""Hunt-Boston"" pencil sharpener, otherwise your colored pencils are eaten.  NEVER BUY X-ACTO for colored pencils, X-ACTO will eat your pencils.  Until you can find a Panasonic or Hunt-Boston, or Hunt or Boston electric pencil sharpener, get this if you can find one, or the Derwent ""BLACK"" model as it had 2 holes, one for a longer tip and one for a shorter tip.  I have both.  I had bought the Derwent one as I have Derwent but also use Prismacolor and graphite.  Panasonic and Hunt Boston are NO LONGER MADE no matter WHAT anyone says.  I was lucky to buy a new PANASONIC electric pencil sharpener by trolling the net until I found on.  Bought a used Boston, model #18, used on eBay and paid waaaay too much.  It was pretty beaten up.Also, if you do buy used, get one in the best quality that you can and just pay the extra, I would say up to $35.  I personally would not spend more than that.  I paid $38 for my new Panasonic.Also, X-ACTO bought out ""Hunt-Boston"" and all new models are a 4 digit model number, the actual ""Hunt-Boston"" is only a 2 digit.  This issue is that X-ACTO still sells under the Hunt Boston name, and it is misleading as it now uses X-ACTO cutters, which do NOTHING but EAT your pencils.  I also do not like it when someone lies about what they are selling.I bought what I thought was a ""HUNT"" electric pencil sharpener, it came in a box that had the Hunt name and packaging, but when I opened it up it was a, you guessed right...  An X-ACTO!!  Said so right on the sharpener.Bought on line here at Amazon from Overstock.com, but I returned it and got a refund, including shipping as they were misleading.Hope this helps with those of you who are colored pencil artist.  Get a PANASONIC, HUNT-BOSTON or Derwent sharpener.Also, run a graphite pencil through your sharpener first thing every day and it will stay sharp longer since colored pencils are waxy and tend to build up on the cutters.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 February 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Four stars for a couple of reasons: they were not packaged brilliantly so subjected to some force during delivery. This may result in the soft leads being broken inside the pencils, time will tell. Secondly, and this may seem a bit picky, the wave pattern on the bottom of each pencil doesn’t line up when in the tin and the name is pointing upwards. For an artist this is really frustrating and looks messy! You can either have a wave pattern going across the bottom of the tin nicely or the pencil names showing but not both. It’s really annoying but if things like that don’t bother you, you can’t go wrong with the actual pencils.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 June 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I thought maybe I just pressed lighter on the 8h, I continued with the rest of the pencils, and everything was perfect. So I did more comparisons of 8h and 9h with drawing lines, different shading, etc, and 9h is definitely darker than 8h, but whatever, I at least now know what to expect from both those pencils, probably just a lull in quality assurance that day. So a star off for that, butt other than that, great pencils, will buy again for their great price and (hopefully more reliable) quality.","Reviewed in the United States on 17 December 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1170","BIC Intensity colored pencils, triangular crayons, colored pencils for painting in 24 colors, in cardboard case, shatterproof lead & without wood (package may vary)","Grundsortiment an Farben","bimpa","Im Lieferumfang befinden sich 12 Buntstifte, bei denen die Außenfarbe jeweils der Minenfarbe entspricht. Hinzu kommt noch, dass goldfarbene Wellenlinien und das Logo von BIC auf dem Stift aufgedruckt ist. Hier weiß ich nicht zu sagen, ob es sich um ein rein optisches Element handelt oder ob diese Linien für mehr Grip sorgen sollen. Verpackt sind diese Buntstifte in einer farblich ansprechenden Papier Umverpackung, die allerdings nur mit einem Klebestreifen wieder zu verschließen ist.Die Farbauswahl spricht mich an, da es die Grundfarben abdeckt. Durch ihre 3 eckige Form liegen die Farbstifte gut in der Hand und sie malen wirklich gut. Bei großflächigem Farbauftrag sind die Farben deckend und auch feine Linien können gut ausgeführt werden. Dazu sind die Farbaufträge sehr kräftig und leuchten intensiv. Die Minen sind schön weich, aber trotzdem brechen sie nicht schnell ab oder werden zerdrückt. Wenn mal die Buntstifte mal anspitzen möchte, ist dies mit einem normalen Anspitzer möglich. Allerdings sollte man drauf achten, dass dieser auch scharf ist, da sonst die Spitzen mehr gedrückt als geschnitten werde.Trotz dieser tollen Stifte habe ich aber trotzdem einen Kritikpunkt. Da man diese Stifte ja mehrmals nutzen möchte und sie auch in einem höheren Preissegment sich befinden, hätte ich eine Verpackung erwartet, die nicht gleich bei der ersten Entnahme reißt. Zudem wäre es schön, wenn man die Stifte gleich auf einem Blick sehen könnte und nicht erst eine Reihe nach der anderen aus der Verpackung nehmen müsste.  Zwar gibt es in der Mitte der Verpackung eine Aussparung, in der man ein paar Stifte sehen kann, aber leider nicht das ganze Spektrum.Zusammenfassend kann ich sagen, dass mich diese Buntstifte überzeugt haben, da sie eine gute Qualität haben und auch sehr vielseitig anzuwenden sind. Lediglich bei der Verpackung müsste etwas geändert werden.","Reviewed in Germany on 13 May 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

Jeder Stift zeigt mit seiner Ummantelung die Stiftfarbe an, was es gerade für Kinder einfacher macht, den passenden Stift schnell zur Hand zu haben.Die dreieckigen Stifte liegen erstaunlich gut in der Hand, so dass sich damit wirklich schön und leicht malen lässt. Mit wenig Druck erreicht man helle, aber dennoch sehr gut sichtbare Farbergebnisse. Bei mehr Druck auf den Stift biegt sich dieser ein wenig, bricht jedoch nicht. Die Farbergebnisse werden dadurch deutlich intensiver.Dadurch, dass die Stifte kein Holz enthalten, sondern aus Kunstharz gefertigt sind, gibt es auch keine Splitter oder ähnliches. Die Stifte lassen sich super spitzen und bisher bleiben auch die Minen selbst beim Fallen vom Tisch etc. super intakt. Bei uns sind Groß und Klein von den Stiften begeistert.","Reviewed in Germany on 10 May 2021","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Nachdem ich meine Tochter jede Woche mehrmals mit auf die Arbeit nehmen muss (Corona sei dank), haben wir diese Stifte kurzerhand mitgenommen und dort deponiert. Dadurch sparen wir uns ein Teil weniger, das wir zum Bespaßen mitnehmen müssen.Insgesamt gibt es 12 verschiedene Farben, die typischen Standardfarben. Einige kleinere Gemälde sind nun schon entstanden und was die Farbintensität angeht, sind wir zufrieden.Die Stifte haben eine Dreikantform. Für die Grundschule (zumindest die ersten Klassen) werden Dreikantbuntstifte empfohlen, um die richtige Griffhaltung zu lernen und zu verinnerlichen. Aus diesem Grund eignen sich die Stifte auch hierfür.Bisher ist keine Mine abgebrochen, obwohl manche Stifte schon den Boden geküsst haben. Sie lassen sich gut spitzen und vermalen.Alles in allem gibt es hier ein gutes Buntstiftset zu einem fairen Preis.

Les ardoises Veleda sont utilisées quotidiennement ici et c'est vrai que les feutres qui vont avec ont une fâcheuse tendance à ... défiler ! Du coup on a testé. Ces craies grasses tiennent très bien sur l'ardoise, sans forcer les couleurs sont nettes, vives. Après un petit coup d'éponge humide, c'est effacé. Comme ils ont une mine ça va très bien pour écrire. Ils sont bien assez gros pour ne pas se casser (on a eu peur que des chutes leurs soient fatales comme avec des crayons de couleur mais il est mentionné ""incassable"" sur la pochette, vu l'épaisseur et la texture, c'est bien possible). Et en plus un taille crayon est fourni quand la mine s'use (ça heureusement parce que vu la taille des crayons, le format est très particulier ;)).Le prix est un peu élevé mais je suis contente de les avoir eu en promo (13€ environ pour 10) et quand on fait le calcul avec leur durée de vie potentielle, tout est relatif...En photo, un dessin sur ardoise ... oui étant donné toutes les jolies couleurs ma fille n'a pu s'empêcher de dessiner au lieu d'écrire :)","Reviewed in France on 14 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Sie gleiten sehr leicht übers Papier, im Gegensatz zu anderen Buntstiften, sodass man tolle Erfolge erzielt. Die Wasserlöslichkeit ist bei kleinen Kindern natürlich ein unschlagbarer Vorteil und man kann völlig entspannt bleiben, wenn mal was auf den Tisch daneben geht. 😉Was ich allerdings super ärgerlich finde: bei der jetzigen Nachbestellung war die Verpackung ziemlich ramponiert und wir dachten direkt, die Stifte wurden schon benutzt (waren aber unbenutzt). Normal würde mich das nicht stören, aber diese Packung war als Geburtstagsgeschenk gedacht und macht so absolut keinen tollen Eindruck (habe zwei Beispielbilder angefügt). Wir werden sie (aus Umweltgründen) dennoch behalten, aber ärgern tuts mich trotzdem, etwas zu verschenken, das aussieht, als hätten wir es aussortiert... 🙁 Würde ich unter den Umständen dann vielleicht doch eher im Laden kaufen beim nächsten Mal.","Reviewed in Germany on 15 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1259","Royal & Langnickel sketching artist pencils - set of 12 drawing pencils 5H to 6B","Good for starters","Tanille Roesler","I'm really glad I made the investment for real artist pencils, having the different varieties of darkness has helped me a lot in the last couple months since I got them.  I don't do that full greyscale shading stuff, barely breaking ground into general shading, no way I can do that.  But it makes it a lot easier for my drawings because instead of how I did it before where I would just try to draw the basic shapes and general outline with pencil, usually mechanical, lightly and then as I went, each new ""layer"" would be slightly darker with the permanent stuff that I would trace over with pen as the darkest, but then when I inked the drawing, let the ink dry, and go back to erase before coloring, it was often very difficult to get rid of all the pencil lines because of how hard and dark I had to go with some of them.  But now with these artist pencils, I lightly do the basic shapes with the lightest pencil, and as I go up in ""layers"" I go one or two pencils up for a darker line with minimal effort amd barely any pressure.  The result is a group of line in varying degrees of darkness that can still be easily erased once I have inked the final outline and I don't have pesky persistent lines and pressure spots showing through my color.  PLUS because you are using multiple pencils per drawing, they last a lot longer before needing to be sharpened.  The one I used most, the 5H, lasted almost two full months before needing to be sharpened and I still haven't sharpened any of the others.  My only beef is a cpuple of them have one spot on the led where it's kind of scratchy and instead of gliding over the paper I can feel it catching.  These are a good set for a starter or someone who doesn't intend to do full greyscale art like me, I doubt I will ever need to move up to a larger or higher end set than this one.","Reviewed in the United States on 27 February 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1286","Royal & Langnickel sketching artist pencils - set of 12 drawing pencils 5H to 6B","Not enough tone difference between the H's and the B's","Sacha","I had high hopes for this set of pencils, because it contained several pencils that I havent had in previous pencil sets - i think the darkest I've had was a 2B or 4B? And these went up to 6B - and I like how the B pencils get much softer and darker the farther down their scale you go. Unfortunately, though, there wasnt an extremely noticeable difference from the 6H all the way through to the 6B in this particular set of pencils. I need the softer darker pencils to be very blendable, and these just weren't. I made a chart where I colored a square using each pencil, in order, using the same amount of pressure in each one. There really wasnt a big difference. Then I tried to shade over the squares to see if the blended or smudged well, and you could still see all of the pencil hashmarks. On EVERY SINGLE ONE. I dont expect the H's to blend barely at all, but the hashmarks on all of the B's should have at least started to smudge. The way I draw consists mainly of shading and tone differences, ranging from really light to really dark pitch black.  I mostly use a stump to blend all of it together, and take turns alternating between my stump and my kneaded eraser to do the actual drawing, to bring out the highlights and deepen the shadows. These pencils just dont vary enough in the hardness for me. I'm going to keep them, though, because I just dont feel like going through the trouble to send them back just to get my five bucks back. I can always write letters with them, right?","Reviewed in the United States on 9 February 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I remember I used to like 2B pencils, but I thought I'd grab a mixed pack and try to gauge how they all lay down. The quality seems great for the cost, they're pre-sharpened. The shaft seems to be natural wood so there's some variations in colour of the wood, which adds a little interest more than anything else. The graphite is transfers nicely and isn't too brittle. I quite liked the 2H the 2b and 5b in particular.The only downside is that I find the plastic packaging sleeve bloody awful. It's too fiddly to keep the pencils in to keep them in good condition as the short top flap is very sharp and stiff and tries to dig into the leads as you slide the pencils back in. Can't even seem to get the plastic to accept a fold back in the other direction to get it to stay open.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The only problem is... they don’t have erasers! Now I know that many fancy drawing pencils don’t have erasers, I’ve used all kinds of great pencils that have erasers though. Not having an eraser on the end doesn’t make a pencil “not cool”. I don’t know how hard it is to put one on... hence the four stars, it’s missing an eraser. Sometimes a tiny eraser like that can be more precise than the erasers you can buy that fit in your hand. I guess you could get the little ones you stick on top, but maybe just buy a drawing pencil with an eraser built in.","Reviewed in the United States on 27 December 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They arrived and brought joy with them. I love how the colours compliment each other, I.e. the colours that are shades and hues simply are lighter or darker versions, which makes it easier to blend for colours you may not have. That being said the selection of colour families is quite good and there wasn’t a single pencil that I haven’t used! I love this set, and from what I’ve seen of other brands, Derwent is a top brand to me!","Reviewed in Spain on 18 September 2018","2.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Off I toddle to trusty Amazon to buy myself some new Derwent Watrercolour pencils and what a lovely price...however...the price reflects the product.Firstly, I noticed that the wood barrels were of different batches so that there was no uniformity..ok, small niggle, but a niggle all the same.Secondly, I found that the colours were very, very weak when used as a crayon and weaker still in watercolour. I know my stuff when it comes to using watercolour pencils (I even checked the instructions as I was doubting myself!) but nope, not as good as the last set at allSo, yes, they do what they need to do, but not as good as the last set, they were just not quite right for me","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Se all'apertura ci saranno sorprese, è un articolo che già da tempo uso, ri-recensirò.Per quanto riguarda l'imballo: è arrivato nei tempi previsti, con imballo APPENA SUFFICIENTE - DA MIGLIORARE - Probabilmente sarebbe stato opportuno che il tutto fosse inserito in un scatolone dalle misure adeguate al contenuto, tanto che quest'ultimo non sbattesse ovunque all'interno del cartone. In definitiva gli incaricati all'imballaggio dovrebbero porre più attenzione nella scelta di dove e come proteggere lo spedito, specialmente quando scelgono uno scatolone enorme per inserire più articoli. Il cartone è arrivato in più punti ammaccato ed un po' lacerato probabilmente a causa del peso del contenuto che, durante il trasporto, si è spesso spostato all'interno dello stesso.

Having never bought this type of thing before, and only using disposable pencils I was very pleased to find that this lead was just as tough and durable as the nano diamond lead that came with my pencil.They are also just as comfortable to write with, the lead is smooth to the touch of paper and flows brilliantly, an absolute pleasure.Not only that but you get so many (40 leads) at such an amazing price. The stylish blue container they come in is very tough and keeps the lead safe inside, and the mechanism in the twist cap to open is brilliant for controlling how many leads you wish to remove from the container at any one time.They arrived very quickly and in a well padded, thick envelope. Very pleased with this purchase and I would highly recommend this product, I'll certainly be buying more when I eventually run out.Pros:- Very durable- High quantity- Smooth flowing- Stylish and durable container (reminds me of an old ipod)- Amazingly cheap- Well packaged- Quick deliveryCons:- None so far, very pleased.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 April 2017","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Arteza colouring pencils are always highly pigmented , I owe also the old 72 count pencil set with smaller cores, this 120set goes a step further , 4mm cores !  You have every colour you will ever need in the beautiful Owl box , my only regret are those horribly flimsy plastic trays. There are 5 of them , colour swatches are on the bottom of the box and inside the hinged cover with names and numbers .  The pencil have on them self their name ,number  & COLOUR FASTNESS . The paint on the pencils is quite correct with the cores . The names ,I wonder who find them in the team ......KOALA GREY, COYOTE BROWN, MARMALADE ORANGE , FRUIT PUNCH , PEACHES AND CREAM  AND  NOW ONE OF MY FAVOURITES :  UNICORN PURPLE !!!  There is not one split pencil in the set.  I had a slight problem with my first set , the Customer care is second to none !  The next day was a brand new perfect set delivered !  I contacted the Arteza team by e-mail and in minutes they responded in minutes. Without any fuss or faff the wanted just my address ,where to send a new set .I owe also smaller sets of polychromos they are without a doubt good pencils , but not for me .  I  prefer how Artezas behave , and also price wise Polys are about £ 157 and Artesas £60 . Both are 120 count . I’m not an artist , but I like drawing and colouring . I was hesitating to buy the big Arteza set because I owe at least twelve big sets from all around the world , but my prefered pencils are Arteza , if possible I would give 10 stars to the pencils & 10 stars to the Arteza Customer Service !!!

"1456","ARTEZA Colouring Pencils, Professional Set of 72 Colours in a Tin Box, Soft Wax-Based Cores, for Drawing, Sketching & Shading","Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo","まくまく","Sono delle matite colorate a base di cera. Ho acquistato la versione da 72 colori e sono soddisfatto. Hanno la scatola in alluminio ed i colori sono posizionati all interno con appositi raccoglitori. Si temperano bene ed i colori hanno una buonissima resa.  Su fogli dedicati da 220 g si possono sovrapporre più strati. In questo caso è opportuno iniziare dai colori più chiari e strato dopo strato aggiungere i colori più scuri. Usando una pressione leggera i colori si fondono bene tra loro mentre usando una pressione forte si rischia di saturare il foglio rendendo poi difficile aggiungere altri colori (poiché scivolano sulla cera compatta). Si temperano bene e nonostante siano a base di cera presentano una consistenza non del tutto morbida che li rende idonei anche ad effettuare i dettagli. Sono ottimi anche ad uso amatoriale e per colorare i mandala ma su fogli dedicati rendono bene epossono essere utilizzati anche per disegni complessi ( uso fogli satinato o grana fine da 220g) Difficile trovare di meglio a 37 euro. Buon divertimentoPro:Rapporto qualità prezzoBuonissima resaSono a base di cera e quindi fluidi e luminosiSi temperano beneBuoni sia per le stesure che per i dettagliBuona varietà di coloriContro:Sono a base di cera e quindi se si forza il colore c è il rischio che si crei una patina cerosa.Per rendere al meglio ci vuole un po' di esperienzaNon si trovano i colori singoliAll apertura della scatola si sente l odore di vernice...ConclusioniSono dei buonissimi colori dall' ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo, perfetti per i principianti, ottimi per lo svago ma che risultano godibili anche dall' amatore esperto.

"1457","ARTEZA Colouring Pencils, Professional Set of 72 Colours in a Tin Box, Soft Wax-Based Cores, for Drawing, Sketching & Shading","Excellent quality, great price, minor problem","Kelly","I'm a life-long devotee of Prismacolor, but my collection was getting nubbie and wasn't ready to invest in a new set. I decided to try Arteza, and was VERY excited and impressed as I started using them. Pigment saturation is great; super-easy to move it around and blend. I was particularly happy about the range of greens available (Always felt Prisma was thin on the green spectrum).Drawbacks: Metallics are usually rough and not very true regardless of brand, but these are pretty terrible. Gold ends up a sickly greenish/brown, and silver is, or course, gray. [Not a big deal because I don't use them much.] The one thing that DOES take Arteza down a notch from the professional-grade pencils is the lettering. Within a month of using them, the names were entirely rubbed off of the colors I'm using most often. First problem is placement: The color name is inked so it sits right in the curve of your thumb/forefinger, the second-highest wear point. [Prisma puts the name as close to the top of the pencil as possible.] Second problem is a combination of size and application. The lettering is large - which is nice at first - but it's all inked over the slick painted surface of the pencil. [Prismacolor goes the extra step of engraving the wood slightly before inking the lettering; you'd have to carve it off.] As problems go, it's not a huge deal. I keep a scribble sheet handy for when Turquoise starts to look Forest-y. Occasionally Black Cherry finds its way into the browns, but did any babies die? No. It's just fancy crayons.","Reviewed in the Netherlands on 1 October 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1458","ARTEZA Colouring Pencils, Professional Set of 72 Colours in a Tin Box, Soft Wax-Based Cores, for Drawing, Sketching & Shading","Great value for money; exceptional set! Definitely better than Prisma's","Cliente Amazon","Great customer service (when I had a fault, I contacted them and they resolved it without any dispute!) and really quick delivery (arrived next day!)...The pencils themselves are fantastic. In the past, I've had a set from WHSmith, Marco Raffine's and Prismacolours. This set far easily outstrips them all. The colour range (in the 72 set) is fantastic - couldn't ask for a better range, especially in the reds, pinks and purples that are lacking in some sets! The pencil core is slightly wider than what I've used previously, meaning you don't go through the pencil as quick. The quality of the wax is definitely better than either of the WHSmith or Marco Raffine sets. Prisma's are oil-based and finding these better than prisma's may be personal preference. I like to lay down a lot of colour when I'm colouring (I can be very heavy-handed), and this destroyed my soft-core prismas -- I just blazed through a very expensive set owing to how I colour. If you're like me, and lay a lot of colour down and like really sharp points, then these are a fantastic choice.When it comes to colouring, the blending and layering is equal to prismacolours and better than marco raffine. The wax in the marco raffine, I think, is slightly harder (and lays down a bit scratchy) which is more noticeable after you've used these.If, like me, you now find the market saturated with choices of pencils, pens and colouring book to satiate all colouring enthusiast appetites, you won't go wrong with this set. I did hesitate at first, owing to the cost and being not sure of the quality; however, you really won't be disappointed. The colours are bright, there's a brilliant range, they blend and layer really well, and are great value for your hard-earned income with excellent customer service: what more could you ask for from a set of pencils?","Reviewed in Italy on 30 March 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They arrived in pristine condition, safely nestled in their tin case within a cardboard sleeve and packed carefully in their shipping box.  I have many other brands of pencils in my collection, including Prismacolor Premiers and Faber Castell Polychromos and after testing these pencils, I can say they definitely hold their own against brands that cost a great deal more!  In appearance, they remind me a lot of Polychromos, with fully lacquered barrels in the colour of the lead and dipped ends.  The core is 4.5 mm thick so I expect these pencils will be quite durable.  Every pencil arrived in perfect condition, no cracked cores, no nicks or imperfections to be found.  They hold their points well, and don't crumble and break like Prismacolors often do.  The colour lay down is pretty effortless, they layer well, and the pencils are highly pigmented.  All in all, I'm VERY happy with my purchase and won't hesitate to purchase more Arteza pencils in the future.","Reviewed in the United States on 7 August 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Bei uns arbeiten die Großen mit Stiften in ganz anderer Preisklasse. Um der Sache gerecht zu werden muss man sie aber nicht nur mit hochpreisigen Buntstiften vergleichen, da sie doch etwas schlechter abschneiden, sondern eher mit normalen Buntstiften anderer Hersteller in der gleichen Preiskategorie. Dann schneiden sie nämlich bei uns mit sehr gut ab.Als unser Siebenjähriger sie gesehen hat, war er hin und weg. Auch seine Zeichenergebnisse sahen für ihn viel toller aus. Er konnte an jenem Tag fast gar nicht mehr aufhören mit dem Zeichnen.Zu den Stiften selbst konnten wir feststellen, dass sie sehr weich sind, eben Wachsmalstifte. Für Wachsmalstifte haften sie sehr gut auf Papier. Das Ergebnis hat satte leuchtende Farben.Natürlich reiben sich die Stifte aufgrund ihrer Weichheit etwas schneller ab, als normale Buntstifte. Mit einem neuen sehr gut schneidenden Metallspitzer konnten wir die Stifte ohne Probleme anspitzen. Es gab keine Mienenbrüche. Wir haben sie allerdings nicht zu spitz gespitzt, da bei der Weichheit eine feine Spitze zu schnell brechen würde.Als ein Stift bei uns unsanft auf harten Fliesen gelandet ist, war die Spitze natürlich ab. Aber vielleicht hilft da auch etwas Erziehung und Organisation. Wir Erwachsene legen unsere Stifte nach Gebrauch auch immer an einen sicheren Platz.Fazit:Zum Üben und für etwas ältere Kinder sind sie eine super Chance, um tolle Ergebnisse zu erzielen. Im Vergleich mit anderen Buntstiften in dieser Preisklasse schneiden Sie bei uns großartig ab. Daher gibt es von uns eine klare Kaufempfehlung.","Reviewed in Australia on 14 June 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I have sets of very expensive professional level colored pencils, as well as kid level sets. I have sets made in Europe, Asia, USA...in other words, I have a LOT of colored pencils. I have been so disappointed with the quality of my most expensive set, breakage, unable to handle pressure, rough wood interior, cost per replacement pencil, etc. In a bit of desperation I decided to try these...and they are lovely!! The color line is gorgeous, they sharpen beautifully (small hand sharpener, not a regular pencil sharpener!!), the box they come in is well made (usually I recycle the box, but not for this set).  The lead is nice and thick, so for fine lines I do need to sharpen them, but they layer and blend so well!! The color name is on each pencil, which helps with remembering which colors I use. They came pre-sharpened, so the first needed sharpening is very easy. The wood inside seems to be very smooth so it doesn’t catch on the sharpener blade. The lead is on the soft side, so very fine lines might benefit from a harder lead, but they sharpen so easily that it is not difficult to get a nice thin line.I’m sold on these pencils and highly recommend them.","Reviewed in the United States on 10 November 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Soy dibujante y me gustan probar cosas nuevas como lápices sobre todo. He oído sobre la marca Arteza diferentes opiniones y me decidí arriesgarme adquiriendo una lata de 72 lápices porque  costaba 0,51€ / unidad.La lata es muy bonita y compacta, parece ser durable. Los lápices están puestos en 3 pisos y sobre la tapa de la lata por dentro está la carta de los colores(72) puestos con sus números, el nombre en inglés y el rango de resistencia a la luz. En general son blandos, los colores son bonitos aunque haya según mi opinión muchas rosas y no son para aquellos a quienes gustan colores neutros.  Las minas son resistentes y pone que miden 4mm.  Para papel blanco están adecuados(hice mi carta de colores sobre papel color natural(sketchbook de la marca Hahnemühle con gramaje de 140g/m²). He podido hacer dos capas en general y no estoy muy satisfecho . Esta escrito que se pueden usar también  para el papel negro, por esto hice la prueba( 4ta foto) y me quedé decepcionado porque no sale como en la foto que ha puesto la marca(hice prueba sobre papel color negro de Talens(Black sketchbook de 140g/m²). Sobre todo los amarillos y rojos se ven fatal!  Así que no lo recomiendo(dibujar sobre papel negro). Además la mayoría de los colores de los lápices no coinciden con el color de su tinta(ejemplo fuerte el color Coral/A203/!). Te salvan los números en este caso.No me quedó claro la resistencia a la luz, ¿Cómo esta hecha? Y porque estos lápices son profesionales, tampoco. Probablemente por esa razón(resistencia a la luz).En dos palabras: los lápices no son malos, al revés, (tienen buen pigmento) pero sirven para trabajos no profesionales y si no se quiere gastar una fortuna.

Leider kenne ich die teure Konkurrenz nicht, weshalb ich nicht sagen kann, ob die Arteza Colored Pencils Expert nun weicher oder härter sind als die von F.-C. - sie kommen mir jedenfalls nur ein wenig weicher vor als Billigbuntstifte vom Discounter.Aber je länger man mit einer Farbe malt, desto mehr lässt sich davon auftragen (eine Frage der Temperatur?). Geschickt zum Mischen bzw. nicht gleich den gesamten Bereich mit nur dieser Farbe füllen! Etwas mehr Deckkraft hätte ich mir von der Schwarz erhofft, egal wie lange man auf der Stelle malt, es bleibt das Papier darunter leicht körnig sichtbar (auch ein Grund, weshalb ich nicht glaube, dass die Stifte so weich sind, wie sie sein könnten). Die Weiß überdeckt bisher keine der Farben. Sie ist wohl nur auf dunklem/farbigen Papier anwendbar.Sicher lässt sich das durch einzelne Zukäufe ergänzen, so wie auch mehr gute Hautfarben. Hautfarbe für helle Typen gibt es 3 (A022 A034 A010) - daher hab ich beim anhängenden Bild viel gemixt, vor allem mit Hellgrau, Ocker und einem Gelbrot. Dennoch ist die Farbauswahl zu diesem Preis ganz prima und ich möchte die Stifte nicht mehr hergeben.Zur Brüchigkeit kann ich bisher nur sagen, dass ein Stift bereits mit abgebrochener Mine geliefert wurde, nach dem Anspitzen aber hielt. Andere angespitze Stifte sind auch bisher nicht gebrochen. Ich hoffe, dass das so bleibt. Nach kürzlicher Erfahrung mit ständig brechenden Kohlestiften im Spitzer kann ich empfehlen, einen Spitzer für Schminke (Kohlkajal) zu verwenden, da diese den Stift offenbar sensilber anspitzen.Gut finde ich, dass Arteza auf den Stiften auch die Deckkraft von + bis +++ ausweist, leider hat sich das in der Praxis aber als nicht so ganz stimmig erwiesen, da manche weicheren Stifte mit weniger Deckkraft, die härteren mit mehr Deckkraft überlagern. Aber das ist nicht bei allen Farben so. Habe daher mein dahingehuddeltes Farbchart nicht um die Deckkraft ergänzt, wie ursprünglich geplant.Wenn ich jetzt noch wüßte, wo ich einzelne Farben nachkaufen kann, wäre ich rundum glücklich. So bin ich es immerhin so sehr, dass ich mich mal bemühe diese Bewertung zu schreiben :-)p.S.: Das Foto mit den Stiften ist entstanden, nachdem ich mir die Stifte sortierte, wie ich sie brauche. Geliefert wurden sie in anderer Reihenfolge.","Reviewed in Australia on 14 June 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Fast delivery, super nice metal box the pens were in - However, they were the ""clamps"" (on the box) that would hold the lid with the box but the ""clamps"" was broken, so the lid went off completely every time I opened the box. But nothing that bothers me (The pens is in a pen case) - the pens are worth the money you pay  - you get a lot for the money I think :). The onely thing I thought was a little bit annoying, was the ""plastic plate"" (or whatever it is called) that the pencils were on (in the box) bc it was to thin and the ""plastic plate"" could barely lift up the pens on it, without having to drop the pencils every time. Well, that's all I want to point out, but I still want to say that everything else is just positive about these pens :).

As they are, I’d categorize my set as a craft-level set, not a professional-level set. Nice pigmentation but limited usage (yes to coloring and cardmaking, no to blending gradients or multimedia work). Annoyingly, water doesn’t move it enough to use as watercolor pencils, but it moves it enough to smear the artwork. I’ve never been able to get a nice dry blend from watercolor pencils, which must have been the accidental mix-up that happened here (I think they crossed formulas accidentally). I have received a refund, Arteza has good customer service. But they also said they aren’t sure when the issue will be fully solved, so maybe don’t order these pencils for a while just to be save. I am satisfied with their customer service. I will have to reorder these maybe next birthday.The 72 set currently is on sale enough to make it crafting-level pricing, if you’re a crafter with no need for blending/gradients and water-related uses (multimedia, resist, use both sides of the paper). The 120 set is a bit pricy for craft-level supplies as of yet, for the specific set I received. There have been some awesome reviews, over years, so it’s probably just the one batch.

Cela faisait longtemps que je les voulais, car j'ai une grande collection de crayons de couleur (Prisma, Polychromos, Guang Hui, Caran d'Ache, Giotto etc....) et j'avais eu de bons échos sur les réseaux sociaux en coloriage art thérapie, à un moment donné (très vite d'autres marques prennent le relais d'actualité).Perso, j'aime l'esthétique des crayons déjà (très beau) ils sont numérotés (bon pour ma part j'utilise pas de nuancier donc..) et alors l'odeur est  à tombé. Elle a une odeur de beurre de cacao, quelque chose de gourmand et d'assez fort (c'est très entêtant on aime ou pas perso j'adore, car je supporte pas les odeurs chimiques...). C'est une odeur proche des Prisma mais en plus fort je dirais, et perso, moi ça me transporte quand je colorie ;)J'ai commencé à colorier sur un colo, mais aussi testé sur feuille blanche, une sensation assez grasse glissante proche des Prisma dans la sensation de coloriage (je me permettrais pas de comparer sur la qualité, car les Prisma niveau pigmentation et qualité sont biensûrs au dessus), une sensation très confortable agréable, et plus facile je trouve que les crayons plus secs avec une pigmentation aussi bonne (après question de goût).J'ai trouvé quand même des traits communs aux Prisma plus que dans d'autres marques.Maintenant, là où je suis un peu déçu c'est le choix des couleurs (trop de vert notamment...) et avec quasi dans chaque tonalité de couleurs 2 couleurs quasi identiques  (pas décelable sur la couleur des crayons ne correspondant pas du tout à la réalité des couleurs une fois colorié ). C'est une marque intéressante et de bonne qualité bon rapport qualité prix (j'ai aussi les feutres que j'aime bien mais moins aussi pour le choix des couleurs...), même si vous trouverez encore mieux pour ce prix avec plus de crayons, pour ma part, ceux qui aiment le côté gras des Prisma mais que vous ne pouvez pas vous offrir dans l'immédiat, c'est intéressant, et ou pour compléter ces gammes de crayons.Nul part il est indiqué qu'ils sont à la cire mais pour ma part je pense que oui, car ils correspondent en tout point à la sensation de glisser et gras que l'on peut avoir avec et que j'aime tant.Une gamme à compléter pour des amoureux des crayons et ou très bien pour commencer...","Reviewed in Canada on 17 February 2021","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1491","ARTEZA Colouring Pencils, Professional Set of 72 Colours in a Tin Box, Soft Wax-Based Cores, for Drawing, Sketching & Shading","A Very Good Set with Caveats","Magi","First off this would be an excellent budget set for a child, or an adult who needs to buy budget priced pencils for their coloring books.  For those purposes I would highly recommend them.  The color choice in the 72 set is excellent, though some could use more depth in shade and I wish there were a really dark inky blue color, however this set is more than enough to blend and get colors you want.  They are very soft in lay down and sharpen to a nice point which does not easily break as some brands do.  They layer and blend reasonably well though not as good as my Polychromos do but I did not expect that at this price point.  I love some of the colors, the pinks and purples and greens are well represented.  The big downside to sets like this is that you cannot buy individual pencils when one wears out, this is a huge disadvantage to someone like myself.  I like to be able to buy only the colors I use the most as often as I need to without buying a whole set.  I got this set for travel purposes, and it will be great for that.  It comes beautifully packaged in a metal tin with 3 layers.  The metal tin is covered in cellophane and then put into a sturdy form fitting box and then shipped in the Amazon box.  Because of this the pencils arrived in one piece with no damage.  Kudos for the packaging.  I can certainly recommend these pencils and they would be great for anyone starting out or who does not want to spend a fortune.  All in all a very good buy and I do not think you will be disappointed as long as you understand these are not the same as Polychromos, or Pablo's or other high end brands.","Reviewed in Australia on 11 May 2023","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1495","ARTEZA Colouring Pencils, Professional Set of 72 Colours in a Tin Box, Soft Wax-Based Cores, for Drawing, Sketching & Shading","Great Variety and Excellent Customer Service","Aquarelle68","These are similar in hardness to Polychromos in my opinion, they are not a soft wax like Prismacolor for being wax. They do leave some crumbs if you use hard pressure but in my opinion don't crumble as bad as Prismacolor. They sharpen well. Good variety in colors Im attaching a color chart, very few colors had any similarity. Picture attached is colored solely with Arteza pencils, Gamsol and a burnishing pencil.  I love the bright colors of the barrels and would say most were true to the color of the lead. They blend well on their own as well as with blending agents such as Gamsol. They have a lightfastness chart on the back of the tin as well as the lightfastness rating on the barrel. Only con and its minor and more to personal likes is having the very end of the barrel covered over so you cant see if a core is centered. If you have any concerns don't hesitate to contact Arteza. This set arrived and had the names rubbing off where the engraving wasn't deep enough and they honored their 100% guarantee upon being notified and sent me a full replacement set.","Reviewed in France on 9 June 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1497","ARTEZA Colouring Pencils, Professional Set of 72 Colours in a Tin Box, Soft Wax-Based Cores, for Drawing, Sketching & Shading","creamy smooth quality pencils for all artistic levels","Crystal W.","These are quality pencils and the packaging is great, the metal tin keeps them secure. That’s a huge plus...So, I’ve used and own several brands of colored pencils, I’m not a professional artist.Although something went terribly wrong on my order and it took a long time to arrive originally was to arrive on 4th but arrived on evening of the 7th.. being a prime item and was promised delivery on 4th- that did bother me & chat was zero help.I want to specify Amazon chat not arteza.So shipping issues need to be approved on.ON THE PRODUCT NOW:)Worth the purchase-but price is a bit inflated in my opinion.Arteza should rethink this increase on price.Myself -if it continues to increase as it currently has been I won’t buy again. I’m partial to PRISMA, however,These are softer than most other WAX pencils on the market other than PRISMA premier. Thus giving Arteza an edge above others on sheerness and layering ability.These are quality I will give 5 stars on that.I noticed that some of the darker colors do tend to be harder leads and thus blending the darker ones lessens.They are a smoother lay down than other comparable brands.DO NOT confuse these with oil based or watercolor pencils as those are different and lay down differently. Arteza has watercolor pencils as well. Make sure you order correct as I have made that error 😂These are wax based.I’ve compared several brands to these and these are more like PRISMA than other brands.If I were comparing these wax based to an oil based pencil, Castle arts oil based run a close second in smoothness.. for an oil base brand.Anyhow, back to Arteza 😍The blunting of the tips I think is to prevent breaking during shipping so you’ll want to hone the tips by using them or a quick  mini turn in a sharpener will remedy it.I had no issue using my hand sharpener to do it, onlyTook one turn to achieve a point.These are harder leads BUT SOFT LET ME BE CLEAR THESE ARE VERY NICE CREAMY PENCILS and less breaking is a good quality on any pencil.So all In all these are worth the purchase for quality, blending and color ability.The colors are PHENOMENAL I love they differ in all aspects as they add more choices to my collection. So, you will be happy with these...Price point I’d definitely say is good but the recent increases has me a bit cranky.. I’d rate these around a 50-60.00 dollar USD for the 120 set. 80.00 seems a tad HIGH.But I’m not judging just one person’s opinion 😍You can’t go wrong purchasing these though, any artist expert or beginner would find these workable and desirable.I tried to purchase the 120 set as it was prime item and delivery was next day, however once order was placed it said it would be 5 days so that upset me and I cancelled it because that shouldn’t be happening on prime delivery items.I was very dissatisfied with that aspect and I couldn’t get a straight answer from Amazon.As I won’t let that reflect my product option 😎That issue shouldn’t really be sellers fault, I was bummed that I wasn’t able to get my 120 set as promised right now. But maybe I’ll try again in the future because these are EXCELLENT pencils.So if you need them ASAP ask about arrival time from Amazon I’m not sure if it’s due to holidays but it was upsetting I ordered them specifically because I was getting next day PRIME delivery And didn’t..And it’s unfortunate there seems to be some discrepancy on shipping.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 February 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1498","ARTEZA Colouring Pencils, Professional Set of 72 Colours in a Tin Box, Soft Wax-Based Cores, for Drawing, Sketching & Shading","Fantastic pencil crayons","Crystal W.","Absolutely amazing pencil crayons.Packaged and presented beautifully in a metal tin box. Each layer has 24 different shades of colours. Each true to its shade.Each colour blends perfectly. I love the way these work. The more you play with them the better techniques you find too. I found many ways to work with them once I started playing around.On different styles of paper and card you can get different effects. Its worth trying each to find your favourite to work with. My favourite being on the card in the picture above. They also work well on canvas card and watercolour card.These leave a stunning shine to the colours. No lines at all left behind, all blended well and they're smooth on most types of card.The pencils are very nice to work with. They do not scratch the paper, they're smooth and creamy and glide across the paper/card. The colour comes out really strong whether using it lightly or pressing harder for shading.I'm no artist, I love the draw and I get through pencil crayons quite quickly so I needed to find some good quality ones.Now these are creamy as I said, when doing deep colouring you can use up more pencil than you want to. I would prefer this and have a smooth colouring journey than cheaper pencils that do not give enough colour and leave lines behind!I did have an issue with my first box, the leads were broken within the crayons so when I was sharpening, they were falling out mostly. After speaking to arteza customer service via email, I received fantastic support and was sent a new pack straight away. My second pack has no issues.I would definitely recommend these pencil crayons. They really are amazing quality. True to colour. Work in many different ways. Brilliant customer service too.","Reviewed in Spain on 10 May 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1499","ARTEZA Colouring Pencils, Professional Set of 72 Colours in a Tin Box, Soft Wax-Based Cores, for Drawing, Sketching & Shading","Light fastness rating on the pencils","Cliente Amazon","Tl;dr: just buy the premium ones, they're cheaper and for most people will do the trick, especially if you're looking for pencil crayons for colouring books.First of all, these pencils feel sturdy. That's probably due to their thickness being 4mm. If you used the premiums prior to these and liked their triangular shape you will be disappointed to find out that these ones are round.I made a little colour swatch sheet so I could familiarize myself with the colours but also what they look like when Gamsol (oderless mineral spirit often used for blending out pencil crayon) is used on them.A lot of the pencils are creamy feeling, some not so much (now I don't know if they correlate at all but I found the less the light fastness -more stars- the creamier the pencil, the more light fastness -less stars- the more gritty it was).As for if I would recommend this pencil crayon. Definitely. But I would recommend in this economy, saving your money where you can. If you are just colouring in a colouring book; then all you need are the premiums, or better yet get Amazon basic's 72 count wax pencil crayons. They are on par with Arteza's premiums. If you're selling artwork, or for whatever reason believe you need expert level quality pencils then you definitely won't go wrong with these.","Reviewed in the United States on 7 December 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Los he usado en libros para colorear y te aceptan dos o tres capas en ese tipo de papel (bristol), lo que me gusta porque con acuarelas de pastilla o tubo la hoja se pone muy rugosa por tanta agua, en cambio con los lápices tengo más control. En papel de acuarela de 300 g también acepta algunas capas y puedes detallar el dibujo con otro tipo de lápices. Para activarlos uso el pincel con depósito de agua que ya tenía de la misma marca y la verdad es que me funciona muy bien. Los colores se vuelven vibrantes al contacto con el agua, sin necesidad de aplicar demasiado pigmento ni demasiada agua. Son un muy buen regalo para gente creativa.

They behave just like watercolours, except better. You can get very fine detail with these, they blend wonderfully, and - what I'm happiest with - they are perfect for creating a base sketch without risking smudging, or visible linework, like you get when using pencil/graphite.This set is a great intro to watercolour pencils, and probably a great set for an intermediate watercolourist as well.

Der Härtegrad passt, so dass man damit auch gute Zeichnungen im Fach Geometrie anfertigen kann.Die Schachtel kam bei uns zerdrückt an, was aber der Verpackung von Amazon geschuldet war. Die Schachtel wurde in einem Kartonkuvert verschickt und dabei zerdrückt.

There are 12 x 8mm pencils in total ranging from 2H to 8B. The degrees of softness are: 2H, H, F, HB, B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B, 8B. They are presented in a nice metal tin which provides good protection and easy access. The highly distinctive blue, silver and black top livery is iconic and it hasn't changed in years.I have used these pencils before and they have never let me down. This set is excellent for building up tone in portrait or landscape sketches for example. They sharpen well without splintering, and are comfortable to hold and use. The graphite is super smooth on paper and does not scratch at all like cheaper pencils. The graphite also erases easily so you can perfect your work. There is something very nice and satisfying about a good quality pencil like this one. This is a great set for any artist or student alike.

"1657","STAEDTLER 100 G12 S Mars Lumograph Graphite Pencils for Drawing & Sketching - Assorted Degrees, 8B-2H (Tin of 12)","Beautiful quality pencils.","René68","Beautiful and quality pencils. These pencils are pretty much the benchmark for their quality of material and standard tonal values I.e. the blackness/hardness. The casing material is of great wood quality.Mars Lumograph 100 series pencils have a little metallic lustre when drawn on paper. So, if you don't want any metallic shining on your drawings then you can buy Lumograph Matt Black series pencils instead. Both kinds have their particular usefulness and none of it inferior to the other. I love these pencils for technical drawing purposes.I recieved the box in time and in a packaging of amazon polybag. The tin box has a little dent on it but that's okay. One of the pencils (F grade) seems to have manufacturing defect. It seems it was broken and then was glued and painted over it. So that can possibly be a disappointment once I use the pencil enough to reach the point of the wood cleavage and if then it happens to be unusable. However, there is no match to staedtler for quality art supplies for professionals.An advice to beginner artists: it is always advisable to start your art journey from average quality and cheaper pencils as long as their tonal grades are consistent. I highly feel that expensive pencils are meant for professional artists if money is a constraint. Once you graduate into a better and experienced artist, go ahead and buy these beautiful standard pencils.","Reviewed in India on 21 October 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Molto nera e quasi ""grassa"", è poco cancellabile come se fosse una matita colorata ed in breve è diventata la mia preferita (allego la palette dell'intero set, a lato di un piccolo bozzetto che feci tempo fa per esemplificare l'uso delle varie gradazioni di grafite).È allora che sono venuto a conoscenza di questo nuovo tipo di matite della Staedtler, sempre Mars Lumograph ma di tipo ""Black"", anch'esse in grafite ma di colore molto più nero del normale per la presenza di una più alta percentuale di carbone; vedendole in vendita qui su Amazon, le ho acquistate per curiosità.Fatta esclusione per la 8B del set Mars Lumograph ""normale"" che è del tutto simile con la 8B di tipo ""Black"", le altre gradazioni non sono da confondere però, in quanto a resa grafica, né con quelle in normale grafite né con le matite a carboncino.Delle prime non hanno quei fastidiosi riflessi lucidi avendo una finitura opaca, e delle seconde non possiedono la friabilità propria del carbone.Sono pastose e poco cancellabili come se fossero delle matite colorate nere, ma a differenza di queste sono sfumabili anche con le dita, hanno una mina resistentissima e molto affilabile, e soprattutto sono di quattro gradazioni diverse: la confezione comprende due matite di gradazione 2B, due 4B, una 6B e una 8B.Io le uso spesso e con piacere perché queste matite Black consentono agli amanti di questo tipo di tecnica, semplicemente ripassando un sottile strato sulle zone fatte con la grafite normale dove si vuole che sia reso un nero più profondo, di attenuare anche l'effetto lucido tipico della grafite.Queste Mars Lumograph Black sono un complemento anche per chi ama disegnare con il carboncino: le rifiniture, i particolari e le ombre più scure possono essere aggiunte con profitto dopo la stesura del fissatore ottenendo risultati molto convincenti.Allego tra le immagini il confronto tra la matita Lumograph in normale grafite di gradazione 8B e la sua ""gemella"" 8B Lumograph Black: entrambe hanno la mina di diametro maggiore delle altre gradazioni: ben 4,5 mm., mentre per le Black 6B, 4B e 2B il diametro è di 3,6.Le Mars Lumograph Black sono contenute in una pratica scatola metallica con una funzionale cerniera apribile (molto comoda per coloro che disegnano sovente anche all'aperto o in altre svariate condizioni ambientali), ed inoltre, al di là dell'abituale eleganza, riportano intelligentemente su ognuna delle sei facce la gradazione (caratteristica comodissima per un disegnatore).Consiglio a tutti gli appassionati di disegno, professionisti e non, l'acquisto delle Lumograph black, perché la resa è in definitiva qualcosa di diverso: diverso dalle grafiti, diverso dai carboncini, diverso dalle matite colorate. Si ha un ibrido di cui davvero si sentiva la mancanza a livello grafico.P.S.:Ora che sto scrivendo noto che ne hanno prodotto un kit in cui le matite Lumograph Black sono tutte di gradazioni diverse, avendo aggiunto la HB e la 7B: le acquisterò non appena ""nanizzate"" queste.Spero di esservi stato utile.","Reviewed in Italy on 27 June 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Having them split into two lines gives so much more options. They are nice & dark, as dark as Cretacolor Neros & darker than Faber Castell Matte but not as smooth as either, you can feel just a bit of grab on the paper. You can erase but minimally & smudging/blending with stumps or tortillons is also minimal but that helps make sketchbook drawings stay less messy.

Bien por vaguería o porque soy demasiado principiante para darme cuenta, voy buscando un tipo de lápiz que me permita negros intensos, pero que luego no tenga que andar con fijadores para que no se me vaya o se traspase a la hoja de al lado. Los Conté igual se acercaban un poco pero siguen manchando allá por donde pasan.Estos cayeron en mis manos después de ver varios análisis. Al principio me resultaba algo extraña la sensación, ya que no son suaves como un grafito, son como una cera dura, pero los resultados me gustaron mucho. Alcanzan negros mucho más intensos que un grafito (aunque el Steadtler normal 8B no está nada mal) y no tienes ese brillo del grafito que puede ser molesto. A medida que los usas y te acostumbras vas obteniendo mejores resultados y te van gustando más. Se quedan bastante bien en el papel, no difuminan mal, no manchan ni necesitan de fijador.

Su madera también me parece bastante buena y no se rompen ni se astillan al sacar punta. Pero eso tampoco me ha ocurrido nunca con ningún lápiz staedtler, ni siquiera la gama escolar, los del nº 2 de toda la vida :)","Reviewed in Spain on 14 November 2019","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The pencils are not smooth at all. So if you want smooth charcoal, this one is not for you. However, if you are a fan of grainy charcoal and use them more often, then its a good product.

 I bought these pencils while they were on offer. I don’t really like them. The pencils snap when sharpening with a Stanley knife (the sharpener is useless like other customers have pointed out). They smudge well but I can’t get the fine detail with these that cub was after. Also the white pencil is useless. Doesn’t do a thing (see video).

"1803","Derwent Drawing Colouring Pencils, Drawing & Writing, Set Of 12, Ideal For Illustrating & Detailing, Professional Quality, 0700671","Informationen","Garibaldi","Ich bin zugegebenermaßen erst vor kurzem auf die Marke Derwent aufmerksam geworden, nicht aufgrund von Werbung oder Werbegeschenken, sondern weil ich schon lange eine gute Ergänzung zur Polychromos Palette suche. Vor zwei Monaten war ich wieder einmal bei Boesner, dort habe ich diverse Stifte ausprobiert und muss sagen, dass die Derwent Drawing super Stifte sind.Ich zeichne inzwischen seit 16 Jahren, habe bis jetzt viele Stifte ausprobiert und bin seit vielen Jahren ein Freund der Faber Castell Serie. Warum? Nun, Faber Castell liefert eine super Qualität, ich habe noch nie eine Palette gekauft in der ein Stift gebrochen / kaputt oder auch nur abgebrochen war, ich hatte noch nie Probleme beim Anspitzen, wenn ich FB kaufe, weiß ich was ich bekomme. Trotzdem suchte ich schon länger eine Ergänzung zu den Polychromos, dadurch habe ich einige schon bekannte Marken und Stifte ausprobiert:Caran d'Ache LuminanceSanford PrismacolorLyra PolychromosSchon vor längerer Zeit musste ich leider Koh-I-Noor den Rücken kehren, weil ihre Künstlerfarbstifte leider nicht mehr die besten sind (vom Preis her sind sie aber immer noch unschlagbar). Aus diesem Grund habe ich die Augen offen gehalten und habe bei Boesner durchprobiert, da ich selten etwas probiere und es sofort kaufe, habe ich die Stifte nicht direkt aus dem Geschäft mitgenommen. Stattdessen habe ich lange Zuhause gesessen und überlegt ""brauche ich sie wirklich?"". Ich bin niemand der gerne 30 verschiedene Paletten sammelt damit sie im Regal verkommen, ich kaufe meist nur Dinge wo ich wirklich sagen kann ""ja, brauche ich auch in zwei Monaten noch"".Hier einige Details zur Drawing Serie von Derwent:Die Stifte sind viel(!) weicher als Polychromos, sie sind sogar etwas weicher als Prismacolors, haben ein sehr schönes Farbbild, reiben sich aber bei weitem nicht so schnell ab wie die Stifte von Sanford. Was mich besonders positiv überrascht hat war, die Farbpalette der Drawing Serie: Hier gibt es sehr schöne natürliche Farbtöne, ich würde sie jedem empfehlen der gerne die Natur auf Papier bringt und zum Leben erweckt. Hervorragende Farben vorallem für Tierzeichnungen, da es schöne Brauntöne gibt, die bei den Polychromos hinten anstehen müssen, auch das Grau ist sehr schön (kalt und warm grau) und es gibt einige Farben für Details wie Iris (attraktives Grün, auch für Bäume gut geeignet), leuchtendes Gelb und beruhigendes Blau.Die Drawing Serie gibt es soweit ich weiß, nur in einer Ausführung von 24 Stiften (inkl. Weiß und schwarz). Ich muss aber sagen, das mir 24 Stifte völlig ausreichen, weil ich sie sowieso mit den Polychromos / Coloursoft gekauft habe. Für alle die gerne mit vielen Schichten arbeiten, habe ich eine sehr gute Nachricht: Obwohl die Drawing Serie (wie Coloursoft) auf Wachsbasis ist, lassen sich die Farben super layern - ich hätte an dieser Stelle auf keinen Fall erwartet, dass ich mit ihnen sogar mehr Schichten aufbauen kann. Im Grunde kennen es die meisten, die diese Rezension lesen werden: Fast alle wachsbasierten Stifte sind zum Layern nicht besonders gut, zwei bis vier Schichten sind oftmals noch in Ordnung, während man bei auf Öl basierenden Stiften gute acht bis neun Layer auftragen kann. Genau hier haben mich die Derwents am meisten überrascht, denn sie haben kein Problem bei zehn oder mehr Schichten, ich habe davor noch keine wachsbasierten Stifte gesehen, die praktisch ohne Waxbloom verarbeitet werden können.Zum Schluss muss ich noch kurz erwähnen, das man sich die Stifte um den Preis wirklich gut leisten kann, weil sie sich nicht extrem schnell abreiben wie diverse andere (Prismacolor vorne weg). Wer eine gute Ergänzung zu seinen (welchen auch immer) geliebten Stiften sucht, um bessere Hintergründe, mehr Schichten oder einen größeren Kontrast zu schaffen, der sollte hier zugreifen. Ich habe den Kauf nicht bereut, mir ist noch kein einziger Stift abgebrochen (ich spitze seit Ewigkeiten mit einem Faber Castell Spitzer und einer Dahle 133), ich habe bisher schon einige neue Bilder gemalt - teilweise auch nur mit den Drawing - trotzdem nutzen sie sich sehr langsam ab. (Um euch nicht zu verwirren, möchte ich sagen, dass die Fotos direkt nach dem Kauf entstanden sind).","Reviewed in the Netherlands on 7 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1808","Derwent Drawing Colouring Pencils, Drawing & Writing, Set Of 12, Ideal For Illustrating & Detailing, Professional Quality, 0700671","絶妙なくすみカラー！","Simone","色鉛筆といえば、手軽で使いやすい画材の代表で赤や黄色〜青や緑など、素直な色味のものというイメージがあったのですがこちらの色鉛筆はちょっと違い、ニュアンスのあるややくすんだ色で構成されています。抑え気味の自然な色味で、他とは違うシックな落ち着いた雰囲気が得られます。芯は太く（５mm）、柔らかいです。粉をワックスで固めた感じというか、どちらかというとマットな質感で、テカリはそんなにない感じ。何色か重ねると、スベってのりにくいことがあり、重ね塗りに向いてるとは言えないかも。とはいえ、私自身が何色も重ねて緻密に色味を作るような描き方を必要としない上、そのままの色味が十分に美しいので、たとえグリグリと無理やり重ねてタッチがヘンな感じになってもそれはそれで面白い効果になるようにも思います。（あくまで自分の場合）芯の太さと柔らかさから、細かい部分を塗るよりも勢いのあるドローイングで使ったら、なんかカッコよく描けた気になります。自然を美しく描きたいとか、古風な画面を作りたいとか、抑え気味の色味で個性を出したいとか、そういうのにもぴったりかと。とても好きな色鉛筆です。追記: 色の見本追加しました。公式サイトの色見本よりも、実物のほうが少しくすんだ色のような気がします。モニターにもよると思うので、参考程度に。本当にシックな良い色です。","Reviewed in Spain on 7 September 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1810","Derwent Drawing Colouring Pencils, Drawing & Writing, Set Of 12, Ideal For Illustrating & Detailing, Professional Quality, 0700671","Beautiful Pencils. Gorgeous Saturated Colours, are Creamy and Perfect for Nature.","Al","Derwent Drawing Pencils are creamy, rich coloured pencils with a dreamy colour palate suitable for landscapes- nature studies, wildlife studies and portraiture. I had originally purchased the 6 pc set, just to try them out. Due to some of the issues I had experienced with the Coloursoft coloured pencils, I did not want to splurge on these just yet. Almost immediately I fell in love with them. These are richly pigmented, and when creating the swatches I knew I had to upgrade. The colours offered here in the 24 pc set (their largest) are gorgeous, earthy tones, and the performance of these pencils are outstanding. Rich pigments, vibrant colours that layer and blend exquisitely. Like the Coloursoft, and the Artists pencils, these barrels are thick, and the 5mm lead allows for a lot of pigment on that lay-down.The issues are minimal. Price - these are expensive. The prices here on Amazon are the best I was able to find and these pencils are worth the asking price. Another minor negative is the thickness of the pencils may get in the way when colouring in, or drawing the tiny details in your pieces. Also their largest set of 24 colours may be limiting to some, and although the colours offered here are just what’s needed for nature and animal studies, you may still be yearning for more colour options (as evidenced when drawing the unfinished dog attached. I had to default to the Coloursoft pencils for the tongue's red tones). These are meant to be more of a companion piece to your other Derwent pencils; Coloursoft, Artists, ProColour, so for further colour options, just reach for whatever set you have. Currently I own the Coloursoft (36), Studio (36), and Artists (72). The Drawing pencils are my favourite so far of the Derwent line.Overall, Derwent Drawing Coloured pencils are fantastic. The 24 pc set is what is recommended as you get the full colour palette in a convenient tin. These are my go to pencils whenever I want to draw anything with four legs and is covered in fur, and those soft, dreamy landscapes. Although these may not be the best pencils for colouring books due to their theme specific colour selection, they perform beautifully, laying down gorgeous and saturated colours, and is recommended for artists of all levels.","Reviewed in Japan on 28 June 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

These are great! Sanguine, Ruby Earth, and Sepia are EXACTLY what I was looking for. These are smooth, feel great on paper, and most of them are beautifully pigmented. The only ones I found to be a bit waxy and weak on color were Green Shadow and Solway Blue, but those aren’t ones I’ll probably use a lot so overall this set is perfect!","Reviewed in Australia on 5 February 2024","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1818","Derwent Drawing Colouring Pencils, Drawing & Writing, Set Of 12, Ideal For Illustrating & Detailing, Professional Quality, 0700671","Amazing Colored Pencils!","Stefanie Troya","Years ago, I was introduced to Derwent Drawing pencils as part of a promo and received a 6 piece set through an art supply vendor. As a colored pencil artist, I was soon amazed at the quality, pigment and feel of these pencils. I liked them so much that I decided to recently upgrade to the full 24 set and saw that Amazon had a fantastic price.The colors in this set are subtle, beautiful shades that I could not find in other sets of popular pencils.  These pencils are truly the elite artist grade colored pencil, in that they are super creamy/waxy and pigmented and layer flawlessly. Though they appear to be marketed for rendering animals, they are equally impressive for rendering flesh tones, and architectural pieces. They work very well combined with other pencils and layer well with oil-based or wax-based brands. The sensory feel of these cross between a wax- based and oil-based colored pencil but with wider leads. From what I've observed, they leave no wax bloom or excessive residue. The pigments are intense that you can go over several previous layers of colored pencil (other brands) and easily leave rich, broad strokes.  They are perfect for final detailed accents on pieces. The Chinese White pencil in the set is also perfect for highlighting over layers of pencil, and covers well on darker papers.As for being erasable, they will erase to a certain degree on most paper. Though, they do so very well on black, smoother illustration board. They don't erase as well on other papers, but I find that if I apply them over subsequent layers of colored pencil, they erase better.For these pencils, paper choice plays an important role. They are bit too rich and bold for regular sketching/copy paper. I find that they work beautifully on vellum bristol, illustration board and erase especially well on black illustration board. They also hold up well on artist professional grade drawing paper that has a weight of 90lb or more. If you are trying to achieve a smooth finish, I probably wouldn't use these on general sketchbook or heavy, broad toothed paper or you will see a lot of the paper's texture.For the colored pencil artist or those with special interest in drawing, these pencils are very much recommended. They're well made, of excellent quality in durability and lightfast ratings (the colors won't easily fade) and the leads last a long time. *Important: You will need a wider hole pencil sharpener for these. Something metal and durable.The Derwent brand pastel pencil sharper is perfect for these pencils.I cannot say enough good things about these amazing pencils and am fortunate to have acquired the full set!","Reviewed in Japan on 26 April 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1825","Derwent Drawing Colouring Pencils, Drawing & Writing, Set Of 12, Ideal For Illustrating & Detailing, Professional Quality, 0700671","Good selection of colours for drawing","Pastora RM","I must now have five or six sets of Derwent pencils, but these, the latest are my favourites. They are a selection of browns, muted greens and blues, off whites and other naturalistic colours. For drawing and sketching naturalistic scenes I think they are a clever selection. You can always add others from the range for bright colours, but these bring a sense of understated beauty to your drawings.The pencils themselves are round with thick leads. they are quite soft - similar to Derwent's coloursoft range and do not hold a fine point for very long. I suggest that (1) you keep a good quality pencil sharpener close by and that (2) Derwent consider making a hexagonal finer leaded version for people who want to do detailed drawings.The colours, like most of Derwent's insoluble coloured pencils blend well if you don't put down too much at once. If you really scrub hard you'll end up with a slightly waxy bloom and it's difficult to put more colour on the top and blend the colours. Almost it acts like a wax resist when you try to pencil over, and definitely like a wax resist if you try to water colour over.If I have a problem with these (and for that matter, most coloured pencils) it's the white. It's pretty translucent. Which may be what it should be and maybe what you want. But I would like a white that was really opaque and you could use for highlights.In summary, if you're into naturalistic drawing these are a good selection and deliver; there's a smaller set for the cautious but I'm glad I got the whole 24.","Reviewed in Germany on 28 November 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They have a fast lay down and blend out with oms very well. The Derwent Drawing Pencils are arguably the softest coloured pencils on the market. They do sometimes break but the quality of the pencils are very good so it doesn’t happen too often, unlike prismacolor.They come in a muted earthy palette suitable for landscapes, wildlife and portraiture. Because of this they wouldn’t be a great set to start off with but a set you would purchase once you already have an established coloured pencil set to use along side of them.All of them are highly lightfast with 23 scoring an 8 on the blue wool scale and one scoring a 7.Overall they are an extremely excellent pencil that I would recommend to almost any coloured pencil artist to add to their collection!","Reviewed in Brazil on 1 May 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I've used them on both pastel paper and bristol board and they worked fine on both.  The white and black in this line are really the best.  The black in this is much darker than my prismacolor black pencil.  These are much softer than prismacolor pencils.  Imagine a combination between prismacolor premier pencils and oil pastels.  I like the smudgy way they blend.  These however are not for everyone.  My prismacolor's hold a point better.  These would be rubbish for detailed adult coloring books because they do not hold a point very well.  People were commenting in the reviews that they liked them for portraits.  I'm a portrait artist and I've done a portrait with them but I didn't love them for that purpose.  They were perfect for drawing furry animals.  I love the color range.  It's really well thought out. Great greys for shadows.  I do not recommend these for lots of tiny detail work, you'll be wasting them sharpening like crazy.  I love these to pieces but will be buying some Faber Castell Polychromos for my most detailed work.Something important to know about these.  They are incredibly lightfast, that's not common for colored pencils.  All but one has the highest lightfast rating of 8 and the one that doesn't is a 7.  This is important to me because I sell my originals and wouldn't want my work to fade on my customers.These work great with my prismacolor pencils so I often use both in the piece.  The nose on the tiger drawing is the only part where I used prismacolor instead because there is no pink in the derwent drawing pencils set.","Reviewed in Australia on 6 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1939","Triangular Colouring Pencil - STABILO Trio thick short - Pack of 12 - Assorted Colours","STABILO Trio thick - La scelta perfetta per le prime avventure artistiche della mia bimba di 2 anni!","The Doc","Non potrei essere più soddisfatto dell'astuccio STABILO Trio thick da 24 colori che ho acquistato per la mia bimba di 2 anni. Questi pastelli sono stati un vero e proprio successo nelle sue prime avventure artistiche, e non posso che elogiare la loro qualità e versatilità.Fin dal momento in cui ho aperto l'astuccio, ho potuto percepire la cura e l'attenzione nei dettagli che STABILO ha messo in questi pastelli. Il design ergonomico e la forma triangolare sono perfetti per le manine piccole della mia bimba. Ha potuto afferrare i pastelli con facilità e iniziare a sperimentare senza problemi.La gamma di colori è semplicemente sbalorditiva. I colori sono vibranti e luminosi, catturando immediatamente l'attenzione e stimolando la creatività della mia bimba. La varietà di tonalità consente di creare opere d'arte vivaci e fantasiose, anche per una piccola artista in erba.Una delle caratteristiche che ho trovato particolarmente preziose è la resistenza dei pastelli. La punta spessa e robusta resiste bene alle pressioni più energiche, perfetta per un bambino di 2 anni che potrebbe essere un po' troppo entusiasta con la sua creatività. Ho notato che i pastelli sono durevoli e non si rompono facilmente, anche quando vengono applicate forti pressioni.La facilità con cui i pastelli si stendono sulla carta è un altro punto a favore. La morbidezza del tratto consente alla mia bimba di colorare in modo uniforme e senza sforzi e ha reso il suo processo di apprendimento artistico molto più gratificante.Inoltre, ho apprezzato la facilità con cui i colori si lavano dalla pelle e dai vestiti. Questo è un grande vantaggio quando si tratta di materiali artistici per i più piccoli.In conclusione, l'astuccio STABILO Trio thick da 24 colori è stata una scelta eccezionale per introdurre la mia bimba di 2 anni nel mondo dell'arte. La qualità, la varietà di colori e la facilità d'uso lo rendono uno strumento perfetto per stimolare la sua creatività e offrire ore di divertimento. Consiglio vivamente questi pastelli a tutti i genitori in cerca di un'opzione affidabile e di alta qualità per le prime esperienze artistiche dei loro bambini.Se hai trovato la mia recensione utile utilizza il tasto qui sotto.","Reviewed in Italy on 18 August 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It is pricy but when it is on offer it is ideal.I like Rotring pens/pencils and I find that they are nice to write with.  The only problem I have had with previous pencils is that the nib mechanisim seems to fail with me.  Bit early for this one but I'm hoping the 600 works with no issues and lasts me a long time.The pencil is all metal and has a nice weight/feel to it with the weight more towards the nib.  The gnarled surface at the nib end is just the right size when holding it.  I bought the 0.5mm which I prefer to write with.At the other end it has a rotator selector for different types of lead; 2H, 4H, 2B, B, HB, F, H.  I guess you select these depending on the size of lead you end up putting in it.I bought the green, it is quite dark which is great - could be describes as a forest green?I liked it so much I ended up buying a 600 pen to go with it.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 July 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2014","Derwent34214 Graphic Medium Graphite Drawing Pencils, Set of 12, Professional Quality, Black","Derwents are some of the best around","Mz Nina, business consultant and aspiring artist","I looove this brand, also all their colored pencil lines.  I know everyone is Prismacolor crazy, but it is hype.  Derwents are just as good and I am a little partial to them simply they are the ones I learn to draw with even as a kid.  I remember my first Derwent kit that Dad bought me, 120 pencils and I was around 8 and we were livi9ng in Australia.I love the water color pencils, the graphite, the ink tense that you can actually draw on fabric with and it stays, and the color soft line.  I also have a few others, but those are my favorites.I would say there pencils are as good as any other including Prismacolor.Just make sure to get the right pencil sharpener no matter what you use.  Get a Derwent battery operated, which is still made or a Panasonic or a used HUNT-Boston, all of which are no longer made.  DO NOT GET X-ACTO, it chews your pencils up and constantly breaks the lead.INFO ON ELECTRIC PENCIL SHARPENERS:I am a color pencil artist, and you need to have either a Panasonic, ""Hunt-Boston"" pencil sharpener, otherwise your colored pencils are eaten.  NEVER BUY X-ACTO for colored pencils, X-ACTO will eat your pencils.  Until you can find a Panasonic or Hunt-Boston, or Hunt or Boston electric pencil sharpener, get this if you can find one, or the Derwent ""BLACK"" model as it had 2 holes, one for a longer tip and one for a shorter tip.  I have both.  I had bought the Derwent one as I have Derwent but also use Prismacolor and graphite.  Panasonic and Hunt Boston are NO LONGER MADE no matter WHAT anyone says.  I was lucky to buy a new PANASONIC electric pencil sharpener by trolling the net until I found on.  Bought a used Boston, model #18, used on eBay and paid waaaay too much.  It was pretty beaten up.Also, if you do buy used, get one in the best quality that you can and just pay the extra, I would say up to $35.  I personally would not spend more than that.  I paid $38 for my new Panasonic.Also, X-ACTO bought out ""Hunt-Boston"" and all new models are a 4 digit model number, the actual ""Hunt-Boston"" is only a 2 digit.  This issue is that X-ACTO still sells under the Hunt Boston name, and it is misleading as it now uses X-ACTO cutters, which do NOTHING but EAT your pencils.  I also do not like it when someone lies about what they are selling.I bought what I thought was a ""HUNT"" electric pencil sharpener, it came in a box that had the Hunt name and packaging, but when I opened it up it was a, you guessed right...  An X-ACTO!!  Said so right on the sharpener.Bought on line here at Amazon from Overstock.com, but I returned it and got a refund, including shipping as they were misleading.Hope this helps with those of you who are colored pencil artist.  Get a PANASONIC, HUNT-BOSTON or Derwent sharpener.Also, run a graphite pencil through your sharpener first thing every day and it will stay sharp longer since colored pencils are waxy and tend to build up on the cutters.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 February 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2016","Derwent34214 Graphic Medium Graphite Drawing Pencils, Set of 12, Professional Quality, Black","Very good pencils, one frustrating flaw...","Lemon","Great set of quality sketching pencils which do what they say on the tin. Four stars for a couple of reasons: they were not packaged brilliantly so subjected to some force during delivery. This may result in the soft leads being broken inside the pencils, time will tell. Secondly, and this may seem a bit picky, the wave pattern on the bottom of each pencil doesn’t line up when in the tin and the name is pointing upwards. For an artist this is really frustrating and looks messy! You can either have a wave pattern going across the bottom of the tin nicely or the pencil names showing but not both. It’s really annoying but if things like that don’t bother you, you can’t go wrong with the actual pencils.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 June 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I thought maybe I just pressed lighter on the 8h, I continued with the rest of the pencils, and everything was perfect. So I did more comparisons of 8h and 9h with drawing lines, different shading, etc, and 9h is definitely darker than 8h, but whatever, I at least now know what to expect from both those pencils, probably just a lull in quality assurance that day. So a star off for that, butt other than that, great pencils, will buy again for their great price and (hopefully more reliable) quality.","Reviewed in the United States on 17 December 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Ich arbeite an technischen Zeichnungen und zeichne/skizziere privat sehr gerne damit. Durch die sogenannten ""Fall-Druckbleistift - Minen"" benötigt man keinen Spitzer, man arbeitet immer mit derselben Linienstärke. Zudem befindet sich am Ende unter dem Druckknopf ein kleiner Radiergummi. Dieser ist mir erst nach längerem Gebrauch aufgefallen und wirklich praktisch.Wer auf Qualität setzen möchte ist hier genau am richtigen Produkt! Lediglich die 3,5mm Minen brechen sehr schnell, wenn man diese zu weit herausfährt oder zu feste aufdrückt. Da diese sehr dünn sind und man da sich etwas an sanfteres Zeichnen gewöhnen muss einen Stern Abzug, nichtsdestotrotz ein sehr empfehlenswertes Produkt.","Reviewed in Germany on 4 October 2015","2.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The 0.7 and 0.5 work fine. The 0.35 was problematic. The lead (graphite) inside constantly broke when pressing the top to reveal more of the 0.35 lead, and it intermittently slipped back into the barrel of the pencil when you finally get the lead to emerge and put it to paper. I Had to remove bits of the broken lead (and the other two leads inside the pencil), make sure no small lengths left inside, then very carefully insert a single 0.35 lead and started again. This problem seems to be solved - so far - now that there is only one 0.35 lead in the pencil. This is a mechanical issue, not the leads in the pencils. These are excellent and produce smooth and consistent marks on the paper used. In conclusion: Initial disappointment from usual excellent Faber-Castell products but will monitor and report back.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 April 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I had already owned a Faber Castell 0.35 mechanical pencil but it broke from a jam due to the fine lead, I assumed it was a fluke. I really should have learnt from my first experience but I had the exact same issue with the 0.35 from this pack, it took 3 months for it to stop working after consistent feeding issues either not coming out to the whole lead sliding out of the pencil, something I would expect from a off brand mechanical pencil.As for 0.75 and 0.50. They are are fine but honestly don't bring anything any to the table that any other cheaper mechanical pencil or in fact a well sharpened standard graphite pencil would offer. Lead is nice I guess, if a little frail but you can just buy the lead separately and put it into another, better pencil. They also look nice with good grip and handling but other brands offer that luxury for cheaper.Looking at other reviews this is a common problem for anyone who actually attempts to use this pencil.

Before I bought this product I was trying to find packs of professional drawing pencils that had great quality to them. I never seemed to LOVE the packs I'd buy until I bought this.This tin includes 12 professional grade pencils (6B to 4H). I love that all of these pencils come in a metal tin for safe keeping. My other pencils I would throw into the cup that holds my micron pens and primsacolor pencils and it took forever to find the size I needed for my drawing. This metal tin is super lightweight which makes travel so much easier and handy. There's a divot in the tin for each of the 12 pencils keeping them from breaking or getting damaged. The pencils come already sharpened. You can't beat the price for this type of quality which is why I trust Arteza products. They are all affordable and you get the same quality product that you would if you paid more for the expensive brands.If you're looking for professional sketching pencils look no farther.

Der Clou an den Buntstiften ist, dass sie sich wie gewöhnliche Bleistifte wegradieren lassen sollen. Dementsprechend ist an jedem Stift ein weißes Radiergummi angebracht.Die Buntstifte haben eine gute Farbvielfalt und lassen sich angenehm auftragen. Ich nutze sie vor allen Dingen zum Skizzieren von Aquarellen oder Projekten mit Alkoholmarkern, da Buntstifte kein Graphit enthalten, was sich störend mit den Farben vermengen kann.Bei leichten Skizzen lassen sich die Stifte auch angenehm radieren. Eine leichte Farbtönung ist dennoch zu sehen, vollständig bekommt man die Pigmente also nicht mehr vom Papier. Dies zeigt sich besonders, wenn man einmal ein wenig fester drückt: je mehr Pigment auf die Seiten kommt, desto mehr schmiert die Farbe und desto weniger wirkt das Radiergummi. Darauf sollten vor allen Dingen Menschen mit einem festeren Zeichenstil achten. Für leichte Skizzen oder sanfte Schattierungen sind die Bundstifte aber auf jeden Fall geeignet.","Reviewed in Germany on 21 August 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I teach piano and I am constantly copying off pages of music so I can highlight aspects in colour for students. I find this works much better for students than everything in black. However, I'm never sure that pupils should go into exams with books covered in coloured markings. After one pupil found it hard to play the piece when we switched from the colour page to the plain music, I thought it would be brilliant if you could rub out colours in the way you can pencil. And so I found these. They make good strong markings on the page as long as they are sharp. I can't comment on colouring in, I'm afraid, as I've only used them for writing in colour.I'm being brave now and writing over all sorts of things in colour on the assumption I can rub it out later.

Update: I have recently had to buy other makes of 2B pencil and I can state that none have been anywhere near as good as these by Oxford.  Even more expensive pencils are nowhere near as a good.  I have been given, as presents, some very highly regarded and very expensive types of pencils which have allegedly been used by high profile and famous writers and authors and these Oxford pencils beat them all, in my opinion.

Certaines mines fournis avec les criteriums sont creuses, et se cassent très facilement. C'est agaçant et la qualité d'écriture est médiocre.

Il materiale più morbido rispetto al legno consente un'impugnatura migliore.L'immagine trae in inganno, pensavo fossero flessibili, non lo sono.😊PRO- Non hanno legno, coscienza ecologica salva!- impugnatura comoda- classica mina di grafite, si cancella con solita gomma per matita- si tempera con normale temperino da matite classiche😬CONTRO- pensavo che la protezione dagli urti data da questo nuovo materiale indicata sulla scatola, proteggesse la mina dalle rotture, si riferisce invece al materiale stesso.Sono praticamente matite normali per le quali non hanno usato legno.Vi consiglio l'acquisto 🎄Spero che la recensione ti sia stata utile 😊","Reviewed in Italy on 27 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

La mina è sempre pronta (ogni matita ne contiene diverse e, una volta esaurite, è facilissimo aggiungerne altre). Il tratto, 0,7 mm, per me è ideale per prendere appunti. Il gommino, praticissimo, cancella facilmente il tratto. Sono arrivate in una scatolina di cartoncino aperta ma non mancava niente. L'assortimento dei colori è casuale, infatti i 4 colori sono forniti in numeri variabili. Ho approfittato dell'offerta Amazon per distribuirle fra i miei figli e nelle varie borse da lavoro.
